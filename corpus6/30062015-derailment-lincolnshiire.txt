30062015-derailment-of-a freight-train

Accident:At around 14:15 hrs on Tuesday 30 June 2015, a freight train derailed on a track buckle near Langworth, 
north-east of Lincoln.

Enviroment:
1:The weather was hot on the day of the derailment, the air temperature reaching 21oC before 09:00 hrs 
and climbing steadily to a peak of 28.4oC at 16:30 hrs.

2:It was the hottest day of the year to date.
3:The Network Rail log for 30 June 2015 recorded three other track buckle incidents, in Cardiff, Worcester 
and Stowmarket,suggesting that the new peak in temperature for the year experienced on that day was a relevant factor

Procedure: 
1:The train divided between wagons 13 and 14 which severed the continuous brake pipe and caused the 
train’s brakes to apply automatically
2:the stress free temperature of the rails was probably less than the 27oC recorded in Network Rail’s stressing database

Hardware/equipment:the track started to buckle when the rail temperature in the vicinity of 101B points exceeded 
its buckling temperature; and subsequently

Maintance-management:
1:There was a pre-existing lateral misalignment in the area of 101B points which promoted 
the formation of a track buckle.
2:there was insufficient ballast at the toe of 101B points to laterally restrain the track from buckling

Unsafe Condition:A long freight train ran over the track buckle at too high a speed for the vulnerable
 condition of the track

Incompatable goals:There was insufficient appreciation of the factors affecting the CRT of the site and its 
vulnerability to hot weather. This was an underlying factor

Supervision:Maintenance work was continually reprioritised or cancelled because the Lincoln maintenance depot
 was under-resourced. This was a possible underlying factor.
