14052015-collision-between-train-and-tractor

Enviroment:The accident occurred in daylight. The weather was dry and bright, with clear visibility.

Communication:The train driver contacted the signaller at Knaresborough signal box using the cab radio 
and reported the accident before the train came to a stop.

Persoanl:The tractor driver started to cross the railway line when the MSL was displaying a red light.

Training/Knowledge:
1:The tractor driver probably did not recheck the MSL when approaching the crossing, 
having used the distant left-hand roadside button to open the gates.

2:The tractor driver has stated that this was the first time that he had driven over the crossing himself.

Procedure:The train driver reported that he sounded the horn at the whistle board, 267 metres from the crossing, 
and then saw the tractor approaching the crossing from his right-hand side. He then sounded the horn continuously 
and applied the train’s emergency brake.

Accident:The emergency brake was operated when the train was around 100 metres from the crossing, but even with 
full emergency brake applied, the train stopped 468 metres beyond the crossing after the collision with the tractor.


Organizational factors:The poor conspicuity of the MSLs (paragraph 64) and the lack of instruction signs at the 
left-hand post on how to use the crossing safely (paragraph 57) were probable factors in the accident.
