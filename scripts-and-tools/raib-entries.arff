'\n  At around 05:56 hrs on 6 June 2013, train 2M43, the 04:34 hrs passenger service from Swansea to Shrewsbury, was driven over Llandovery level crossing in the town of Llandovery in Carmarthenshire, Wales, while the crossing was open to road traffic. As the train approached the level crossing, a van drove over immediately in front of it. A witness working in a garage next to the level crossing saw what had happened and reported the incident to the police.\n\nThe level crossing is operated by the train’s conductor using a control panel located on the station platform. The level crossing was still open to road traffic because the conductor of train 2M43 had not operated the level crossing controls. The conductor did not operate the level crossing because he may have had a lapse in concentration, and may have become distracted by other events at Llandovery station.\n\nThe train driver did not notice that the level crossing had not been operated because he may have been distracted by events before and during the train’s stop at Llandovery, and the positioning of equipment provided at Llandovery station relating to the operation of trains over the level crossing was sub-optimal.\n\nRAIB identified that an opportunity to integrate the operation of Llandovery level crossing into the signalling arrangements (which would have prevented this incident)was missed when signalling works were planned and commissioned at Llandovery between 2007 and 2010. The RAIB also identified that there was no formalised method of work for train operations at Llandovery.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations. Four are to the train operator, Arriva Trains Wales, and focus on improving the position of platform equipment, identifying locations where traincrew carry out operational tasks and issuing methods of work for those locations, improvements to its operational risk management arrangements and improving the guidance given to its duty control managers on handling serious operational irregularities such as the one that occurred at Llandovery.\n\nTwo recommendations are made to Network Rail. These relate to improvements to its processes for signalling projects, to require the wider consideration of reasonable opportunities to make improvements when defining the scope of these projects, and consideration of the practicability of providing a clear indication to train crew when Llandovery level crossing, and other crossings of a similar design, are still open to road traffic.\n\nR112014-140515-Llandovery.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Llandovery\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near-miss_at_llandovery_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 12 May 2007 a steam locomotive hauled passenger train was travelling from Dalegarth to Ravenglass at 5-7mph when the trailing bogie on the third coach derailed at Hollin How near Fisherground. There were no passenger injuries or significant damage to the train or track.\n\nThe cause of the derailment was flange climb of the leading right wheel of the trailing bogie on the third coach. This resulted directly from the collapse of the suspension on the left-hand side of the leading bogie, due to a compensating bar becoming detached. This probably occurred because the bar had not been refitted correctly after safety inspections, and the vehicle then entered service with the fault undetected.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at the checking of safety critical work on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway.\n\nR322007-070830-Fisherground.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Fisherground\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/passenger_train_derailment_ravenglass_&_eskdale_railway.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  During the morning of 8 March 2013, a train driver reported that flood water was flowing from the roof of a railway tunnel north of Old Street station near central London. The driver of an out-of-service passenger train was asked to examine the tunnel at low speed and check for damage. The driver stopped short of the water flow and reported that two large drills (augers) had come through the tunnel wall and were fouling the line ahead of his train.\n\nThe augers were being used for boring piles from a construction site about 13 metres above the top of the tunnel. The operators of the piling rig involved were unaware that they were working above an operational railway tunnel. Its position was not shown on the site plan, or on any map available to either the developer or the local planning authority. As a consequence, Network Rail was not consulted during the planning application stage and was unaware of the construction activity.\n\nThe RAIB has determined that approximately half of the piles required for the new development would have intersected with the tunnel had they had been constructed. It has identified two learning points from this incident which are relevant to the construction industry: clients and design teams should be aware of the importance of information shown on land ownership records; and those carrying out investigations for proposed developments should be aware that not all railway tunnels are shown on Ordnance Survey mapping.\n\nThe RAIB has also made five recommendations: three are addressed to railway infrastructure managers, and relate to: the provision of information to organisations undertaking property-related searches; the provision of information on the location of railway tunnels and associated subterranean structures; and the identification of development work by third parties. One recommendation is made to the British Standards Institution relating to the enhancement of a British Standard, and one recommendation is addressed to the Department for Communities and Local Government relating to a recommendation made by the RAIB in 2007 which has not been implemented.\n\nR032014-140213-Old-Street.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:#\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Old Street and Essex Road\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail and 1 others/penetration_of_a_tunnel_at_old_street.txt','Heavy rail and 1 others'
'\n  On 10 June 2007 at approximately 17:35 hrs, a northbound train to Edgware was travelling on the Northern Line when, due to repair work, it was incorrectly routed into the High Barnet platform at Camden Town. To correct this, the train directly behind it was deliberately routed to Edgware for the passengers and crew to exchange trains. During the exchange, a driver entered the wrong end of the High Barnet train and drove southwards for 108 metres, before stopping 20 metres away from an approaching train. There was no collision, derailment or injuries to passengers or staff.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the train driver entered the incorrect cab when joining the train and drove the train in the wrong direction from Camden Town station. The driver did not carry out the correct procedure for starting a train from a station. There were five contributory factors which involved train crew unfamiliarity with changing trains at Camden Town, inappropriate use of the train regulation equipment while under repair, and the driver did not observe and respond to the stop board.\n\nLondon Underground Ltd (LUL) have taken action to prevent similar incidents, including additional staff training and changes to operational procedures. They have also improved the reliability of train regulation equipment which controls the routing of trains.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to address causal and contributory factors. These concern:\n\n\n  installation of warning signs at Camden Town\n  instructions for drivers when they leave a cab of a train to be replaced by driver\n  recording technical interventions in the control room\n  familiarity induction to stations where drivers may be required to change platforms between trains.\n\n\n R062008-080311-Camden-Town.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Camden Town\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/tube_train_driven_in_the_wrong_direction_camden_town.txt,Metros
'\n  At 12:31 hrs on 4 December 2012 a collision occurred between a passenger train and a car at Beech Hill automatic half barrier (AHB) level crossing near Finningley, on the line between Gainsborough and Doncaster. One of the occupants of the car, a young child, was seriously injured in the collision and later died in hospital.\n\nThe train involved was operated by East Midlands Trains. It consisted of a single carriage unit and was travelling at 60 mph (96 km/h) at the time of the collision. None of the 20 passengers and two crew members on the train was injured in the accident. Equipment beneath the train was damaged in the collision leading to the spillage of diesel fuel from the train’s fuel tank, but there was no fire.\n\nThe level crossing was owned and maintained by Network Rail and was fitted with a data logger which showed that the crossing was operating normally at the time of the accident, with the barriers down as the car approached. The car driver stated that she did not see that the road traffic light signals (known as wig-wags) were flashing as she approached and only noticed the lights and barriers when she was very close to the crossing. The weather was sunny at the time of the collision but there had been rain showers earlier and the road surface was wet, leading to glare from the low winter sun.\n\nThe RAIB took the wig-wag units and arranged for testing in an optical laboratory. It was found that they were fitted with 36 W lamps and an obsolete design of red lens unit. Their light output was measured to be well below the specification for lights of this type. Network Rail had no plans in place to replace the light units with brighter ones and had no process to identify that such replacement was necessary.\n\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations as follows:\n\n\n  infrastructure managers to determine which level crossings are fitted with 36 W lamps and draw up plans for their replacement with LED units\n  infrastructure managers to devise a method of assessing the risk of a bright background and glare preventing wig-wag signals from being seen and propose means of mitigating this\n  infrastructure managers to introduce a new ‘brighter’ type of LED wig-wag for use at sites where sunlight glare has been identified as a problem\n  infrastructure managers to enhance the inspection and maintenance process for wig-wag lamps.\n\n\nR172013-130924-Beech-Hill-v2.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Beech Hill LC\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail and 2 others/collision_at_beech_hill_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail and 2 others'
'\n  On Tuesday 30 May 2006 a prototype tram with a new type of running gear derailed on a curved section of the loop at Starr Gate on the Blackpool Tramway. The tram was undertaking a series of test runs when the derailment occurred at low speed. There were no injuries or significant damage caused by the incident.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the tip of the flange on a wheel contacted a worn section of the rail on the inner radius of the track curve and so climbed onto the rail head. The derailment risks associated with the operating of this type of tram on such a section of curved and worn track had not been previously identified and were therefore not mitigated.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  further understanding the dynamic behaviour of the prototype tram;\n  controlling rail wear on the Blackpool tramway.\n\n\nR152007-070529-Starr-Gate.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.  \n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Starr Gate\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/derailment_at_starr_gate.txt','Light rail'
'\n  A summary of the key points from the report is included below -\n\nThe derailment and the subsequent response\n\nOn Friday 23 February 2007 a Virgin West Coast train from London Euston to Glasgow derailed on 2B points at Lambrigg, near Grayrigg in Cumbria, while travelling at the authorised speed of 95mph (153 km/h). All nine carriages of the Class 390 Pendolino were derailed. There were at least 105 passengers and four crew on board. One passenger was fatally injured, 28 passengers, the train driver and one other crew member were seriously injured, and 59 passengers received minor injuries.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the deterioration of 2B points through a combination of failures of the three stretcher bars, the lock stretcher bar, and their fastenings. This allowed the left-hand switch rail to move into an unsafe position close to its stock rail, without losing signalling detection. This came about as a result of a combination of three factors, which were:\n\n\n  the mechanical failure of a bolted joint\n  the incorrect set up the points\n  a track inspection that was missed on 18 February 2007.\n\n\nAll three factors were necessary for the accident to occur.\n\nContributory factors to the missed inspection included limited access times for maintenance of the West Coast Main Line at Grayrigg.\n\nUnderlying factors included:\n\n\n  Network Rail, perceived, based on the performance to date, that the risk associated with this design of S&C was low\n  within Network Rail there was an incomplete understanding of the design, maintenance and inspection of the design of stretcher bars used in 2B points due to the limited application of a risk-based assessment.\n\n\nIn the thirty five years since the design of points used in 2B points was introduced there has been no previous catastrophic accident associated with the type of stretcher bars used in the design.\n\nImmediately after the accident Network Rail carried out an extensive check of points on their system. Although some defects were found there were no other stretcher bars in a similar state to that of 2B points, with all three factors present.\n\nAs a result of the emerging findings from the investigation RAIB issued Urgent Safety Advice to the industry relating to: the inspection and maintenance of points on 6 June 2007; and the design of fastener systems, and their relevant to inspection processes, on 26 November 2007. This advice was sent to Network Rail, and also to Nexus, Manchester Metrolink, Northern Ireland Railways and London Underground, who all use a similar design of points.\n\nNetwork Rail has reported it is taking steps to improve the set up and inspection of points similar to 2B points, and has strengthened its management of these activities. New instructions have also been issued for the standardisation of track inspection.\n\nNetwork Rail is now carrying out work to assess the design of this type of points in order to assess any modifications to the design and maintenance/inspection regime.\n\nPotters Bar\n\nAll of RAIB’s investigations consider the relevance of previous similar occurrences. In this context RAIB considered the accident at Potters Bar in May 2002 where seven persons lost their lives. Whilst the type of points involved were different, a recommendation made by the Potters Bar Investigation Board (dated May 2003) identified the need for Network Rail to apply a risk-based approach to the management and maintenance of its points assets based on an understanding of the design and safety requirements. Network Rail had accepted the value of such an approach but did not consider its application to existing points with non-adjustable stretcher bars to be a priority.\n\nThe train\n\nThe train performed better than has been seen with earlier designs of trains in previous accidents. The passenger and crew areas were not significantly compromised; only two windows did not fully retain people within the carriages, the bogies did not separate form the carriage bodies. However, RAIB considers that safety could be improved by improving the design of seat mountings, and the lighting panels above the seats and has made further recommendations for the study of rail vehicles in ‘roll over’.\n\nThe rescue\n\nThe rescue of the passengers by the emergency services was swift, proportionate and well co-ordinated. However, RAIB has identified some areas where further improvements could be made.\n\nRecommendations\n\nRAIB has made twenty-nine safety recommendations. Twenty-one of these are directed at Network Rail. The primary long-term recommendations relate to a review of the design, inspection and maintenance of points, and particularly non-adjustable stretcher bar systems as used on 2B points. The short-term recommendations relate to mitigation of the risk from points in advance of the implementation of the longer- term recommendations. Further recommendations are targeted at Network Rail to address the underlying technical and managerial issues, and an issue of fatigue of staff.\n\nEight recommendations are directed at other organisations. They primarily deal with issues relating to: the behaviour of the train as a consequence of the derailment; and the rescue services.\n\nThe Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), the safety regulator for the railway industry, broadly supports the report and the findings. The responsibility of the ORR is to ensure that the recommendations that are directed at industry parties are duly taken into consideration and where appropriate acted upon. The ORR then has to report back to RAIB on the measures taken to implement the recommendations or explain why measures have not been taken.\n\nR202008-081023-Grayrigg-v5.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Grayrigg\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_grayrigg.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  A steam locomotive hauling a passenger train on the Kirklees Light Railway on 3 July 2011 ran low on water in the boiler. The train crew did not take prompt action to deal with the situation and the boiler overheated, damaging the locomotive and giving rise to a risk of injury to the train crew if the overheated metal had ruptured.\n\nThe cause of the incident was that the driver did not ensure that sufficient water was put into the boiler during the journey and did not remove the fire from the locomotive when he realised the water had run low. The driver had just completed his training for driving steam locomotives. The underlying cause was that the Kirklees Light Railway’s safety management system was inadequate to deal with the risks arising from operation of a steam railway.\n\nTwo recommendations have been made to the Kirklees Light Railway concerning their safety management system and operating procedures.\n\nR042012-120313-Kirklees.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Kirklees \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/incident_on_the_kirklees_light_railway.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  At around 12:20 hrs on 21 May 2012, a volunteer train guard was fatally injured after becoming trapped between two coaches at Grosmont station on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The coaches had just been uncoupled and the accident occurred when the steam locomotive that was reversing the uncoupled coach away from the stationary coaches changed its direction. The driver applied the brake as soon as he realised this, but there was insufficient distance to stop and avoid trapping the guard who had moved back between the vehicles to complete the work associated with the uncoupling.\n\nThe locomotive changed direction because its screw reverser was not locked and moved under the weight of the valve gear from reverse to forward gear. It is likely that the guard moved back between the coaches because he had no reason to believe that the locomotive and coach moving away from him would change its direction.\n\nRAIB has identified two key learning points relating to the locking of screw reversers and not going between railway vehicles unless they are stationary. It has also made a recommendation to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway relating to the competence management system covering shunting.\n\nR232012-121018-Grosmont.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Grosmont\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail and 1 others/fatal_accident_at_grosmont.txt','Heavy rail and 1 others'
'\n  On 10 March 2009, a Docklands Light Railway service became derailed as it travelled through a set of points at North Quay junction, just north of West India Quay station.  There were no injuries to the 80 passengers or the passenger service agent on board the train. \n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was that the train travelled through the points in a trailing direction when the points were not correctly set for this movement, and derailed.\n\nThe causal factors which led to the derailment were that the passenger service agent did not identify that the points were set reverse, or see the unlit point position indicator and stop the train; the control centre controller did not intervene to stop the movement of the train or follow the emergency procedure; and the control centre controller was not aware of the exact position of the train.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations which include the criteria for the location of point position indicators and the review of their sighting and subsequent improvements; alarm management systems in the system management centre; the replacement of all point position indicators with ones that are more conspicuous when lit; and adequate control of changes to the design and operations of the railway.\n\nR032010-100304-West-India-Quay.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for West India Quay\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/derailment_near_west_india_quay_station.txt,Metros
'\n  At 00:16 hrs on 5 June 2011, a Manchester Metrolink tram struck and fatally injured a pedestrian.\n\nThe tram was approaching Piccadilly Gardens, from the direction of Market Street, at a speed of about 9 mph (15 km/h) when a pedestrian ran into its path. The pedestrian appeared to become aware of the tram and tried to stop before reaching the track, but fell directly in front of the tram. Although the tram had started to brake before reaching the pedestrian, it did not come to a complete stand before the pedestrian had come into contact with the under-run protector. This is a device that projects down from the underside of the tram and is designed to prevent pedestrians from being crushed under the wheels.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to UK tram operators in conjunction with UKTram (a body representing UK tram operators). These relate to improvements in the collection of pedestrian injury data in order to better understand the role of the tram front end design in minimising injury, and to research into the design of tram front ends and their potential for injuring pedestrians in collisions.\n\nR082012-120530-Piccadilly-Gardens.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Piccadilly Gardens\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/fatal_accident_at_piccadilly_gardens.txt','Light rail'
'\n  At about 14:35 hrs on 17 November 2014, a train travelling at 110 mph (177 km/h) struck the top of a signal which had collapsed and fallen across the railway line near Newbury. The signal post completely obstructed one track and partially obstructed a second (the one on which the train was travelling). There were no injuries and the train did not derail, but it did sustain some exterior damage. The outcome could have been much more serious if the first train to encounter the collapsed signal had been travelling at speed on the completely obstructed track.\n\nThe signal collapsed because the base of the post, which was of hollow tubular steel construction, had corroded through, causing an almost complete loss of wall thickness at and just above ground level. Corrosion had occurred to both internal and external surfaces; internally because water had entered the post and there was no drainage for it to escape, while the external corrosion was affected by the base being buried in ballast, which held water around the base and damaged the protective coating on the signal post.\n\nSignal posts are subject to annual visual examinations, but the examinations of this signal did not detect the problem because the main area of corrosion was hidden by ballast, and the examinations regime was vulnerable to missing such defects. A separate examination in 2012 for a resignalling project in the area also did not detect the defect for similar reasons. Because the defect was not detected, it was not reported and remedied through maintenance.\n\nThe investigation also identified possible underlying factors associated with the management of ballast levels around post bases, competence management of structures examiners and corporate knowledge about the original design specifications for signal structures.\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation RAIB has made five recommendations. Four of the recommendations are addressed to Network Rail and cover the management and examination of signal structures and their resistance to such failures. The fifth recommendation is addressed to Amey regarding its competence management arrangements for structures examiners.\n\nRAIB has also identified a learning point relating to the process for conducting visual examinations on structures such as signal posts.\n\nR152015_150923_Newbury \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Newbury\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_with_a_collapsed_signal_post_at_newbury.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 18:50 hrs on 23 November 2013, while a steam-hauled passenger train from London Waterloo to Weymouth was approaching Winchfield in Hampshire at about 40 mph (64 km/h), the right-hand connecting rod of the locomotive became detached at its leading end (referred to as the small end), which dropped down onto the track. The driver stopped the train immediately, about one mile (1.6 km) outside Winchfield station. There was some damage to the track, but no-one was hurt. The accident could, in slightly different circumstances, have led to derailment of the train.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the small end assembly came apart, allowing one end of the connecting rod to drop to the ground. The reasons for this could not be established with certainty because some components could not be found after the accident. It is possible that the gudgeon pin securing nut unwound following breakage of the cotter and previous loosening of the nut. A possible factor is that the design of some components had been modified during the restoration of the locomotive some years earlier, without full consideration of the possible effect of these changes. There were deficiencies in the design and manufacture of the cotter. It is also possible, but less likely, that the securing nut split due to an inherent flaw or fatigue cracking.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations, directed variously to West Coast Railway Company, the Heritage Railway Association, and the Main Line Steam Locomotive Operators Association. They cover the maintenance arrangements for steam locomotives used on the national network, a review of the design of the small end assembly on the type of locomotive involved in the accident, guidance on the design and manufacture of cotters, and assessment of risk arising from changes to the details of the design of locomotives.\n\nR132014-140616-Winchfield.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Winchfield\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail and 1 others/locomotive_failure_near_winchfield.txt','Heavy rail and 1 others'
'\n  At 17:29 hrs on 11 July 2011, a loaded passenger train on the Victoria Line of London Underground departed from Warren Street station with all the passenger saloon doors open on the platform side of the train. When the train reached 8 km/h, a safety system on the train closed the doors, but not before the train had entered the tunnel with the leading set of saloon doors open. No-one was hurt in the incident.\n\nThe train, consisting of new 2009 tube stock, is fitted with sensitive edge doors designed to apply the brakes if a thin object trapped by the doors is detected. The sensitive edge system was activated when the train stopped at the previous station, Oxford Circus.\n\nThe train left Warren Street station with the doors open because the train operator had omitted to close them, having previously disabled the train door interlock (a safety system that requires the doors to be closed before a train can start). The train operator was unable to reset the sensitive edge system between Oxford Circus and Warren Street, and became more and more confused in his attempts to resolve it. RAIB found that the modification to allow train operators to override an activated sensitive edge system had changed the operation of an indication light, which probably misled the train operator. Deficiencies in the train operator’s competence had not been identified and this lack of competence was also a probable factor leading to the train operator’s confusion.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to London Underground Ltd covering a review of the guidance and instructions to train operators relating to resolving activated sensitive edge systems; the process of managing engineering change; the competence management of train operators; and the requesting of operational and technical support by train operators.\n\nR132012-120705-Warren-Street.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Warren Street\n\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/doors_open_on_train_at_warren_street.txt,Metros
'\n  At 13:25 hrs on 20 April 2011, a tram travelling towards the Jewellery Quarter tram stop on the Midland Metro struck an item of overhead line equipment (OLE), known as a cantilever, which had previously become partially detached from its supporting pole. This damaged the tram and led to a progressive collapse of the OLE for about 200 metres, which resulted in further damage to the tram. Three adult and three child passengers suffered injuries which required hospital treatment as a result of the accident.\n\nThe cantilever became detached because part of the assembly which connected it to its supporting pole, known as the reducing sleeve, had fractured after becoming mechanically overloaded.\n\nThis overload resulted from a combination of the cantilever becoming momentarily restrained at some point along its length and either the introduction of an abnormal load (following the failure of a tensioned component) or the action of operating loads within the OLE. The cantilever may also have been restrained to some degree from rotating around its supporting pole. This restraint, the way in which the cantilever was installed, the ambient temperature and reduced clearances around tensioned components were also possibly factors in creating the overload.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations to National Express Midland Metro.

'\n  On 14 May 2015, a passenger train collided with a tractor at Oakwood Farm user worked crossing near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The train was carrying 66 people and travelling at 65 mph (105 km/h), but did not derail. The collision caused the front of the tractor to become detached from its cab. The tractor driver suffered minor injuries, and the train driver was treated for shock. However, in different circumstances the consequences could have been much worse.\n\nThe tractor driver began crossing the railway after the illuminated warning at the crossing started to display a red light. Oakwood Farm user worked crossing is one of a small number in the country that had been fitted with remotely operated, powered gates. It is likely the tractor driver did not recheck the warning lights after first stopping on the approach to the crossing to press a button to open the gates. This button had not originally been intended to open the gates (it should only have been capable of being used to close them). It was situated at such a distance from the crossing that the time it took for the tractor driver to stop, open the gates and then drive onto the crossing, was greater than the time between the warning light turning red and the arrival of the train. There was no sign at the button to warn the driver to recheck the warning light before going over the crossing. The investigation also found that the warning light was not conspicuous among the many signs present at the crossing. \n\nThe underlying causes of the accident were that Network Rail did not ensure that the risks at the crossing were adequately mitigated, and that the process for the introduction of the gate operating equipment was adequately managed.\n\nAs a result of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail. \n\nThe first is to improve the safety at Oakwood Farm user worked crossing and the second is to review the safety of other user worked crossings fitted, or planned to be fitted, with the remotely operated gate opening equipment. \n\nThe third recommendation is for Network Rail to review the robustness of its processes for introducing new equipment on to its railway infrastructure.\n\nR072016_160428_Oakwood_Farm\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Oakwood Farm\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_between_train_and_tractor.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Sunday 16 April 2006 a locomotive hauling a passenger service on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway suffered a blowback of its fire south of Grosmont station. The blowback filled part of the footplate with flame for between 4 and 10 seconds. The locomotive driver suffered minor burns.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was a loss of forward draft at a time that the firehole doors were open. The loss of draft was caused by the failure of a blastpipe base/saddle plate weld that was made undersized when the locomotive was originally built, allowing the blast pipe to move out of line. There were two causal factors, eight contributory factors and two underlying causes identified.\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations as a result of its investigation. These cover:\n\n\n  the size, inspection and repair of blast pipe base/saddle plate welds;\n  provision for mechanical inspections when outsourcing work;\n  assessment of hazards to train crew and public in the development of maintenance schedules;\n  provision of first aid kits on minor railway locomotive footplates;\n  annealing of copper blower feed pipes; and\n  notification of incidents between the heritage sector and the mainline railway.\n\n\nR042007-070130-Grosmont.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Grosmont\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/the_blowback_of_a_locomotive_fire_at_grosmont.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  At approximately 12:35 hrs on 12 May 2014, an unmanned train ran away for a distance of around 1.8 miles (2.9 km) before colliding with a set of unattended coaches. The collision occurred about 450 metres south of Loughborough Central station, located on the Great Central Railway. This is a heritage railway, and no train services for public use were being operated on the day of the accident. Nobody was injured as a result of the collision, although significant damage was sustained by some of the rail vehicles involved. The train which ran away had been previously left unattended within a possession on a main line opposite Quorn signal box. The railway at Quorn is on a gradient which descends towards Loughborough.\n\nThe train which ran away consisted of a locomotive coupled to a single coach. RAIB’s investigation found that, before the train was left unattended, the air brakes on the locomotive had been applied by the driver and a single wheel scotch had been positioned against one of the locomotive’s wheels by a member of staff. The handbrakes on the locomotive were not applied and the coach was not secured with either brakes or a wheel scotch. \n\nRAIB has concluded that the train ran away because the wheel scotch was positioned against the locomotive’s wheel in a way which made it ineffective. The RAIB determined that the handbrakes on the locomotive, had they been used, would have provided sufficient braking force to have held the train. The driver did not apply the locomotive’s handbrakes because he believed that they were not effective on this class of locomotive and that the wheel scotch would provide sufficient braking force, should the pressure in the air braking system leak away. The driver may also have been influenced by the prevailing practices on the railway which related to the use of handbrakes. \n\nThe train was not left in a location where it would have been protected from running away by the arrangement of the infrastructure. This was probably because the staff involved thought that these locations were either not available or needed disproportionate time to access. It may also have been because they had a reduced perception of the risks of leaving trains unattended outside of these locations.\nRAIB found that checks by the Great Central Railway’s managers did not detect the full-extent of the unsafe and non-compliant practices present within possessions. The investigation also found that some of the rules relating to the way in which rail vehicles were to be left unattended were inconsistent and potentially unclear. \n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has identified two key learning points. These are: that the movement of trains not connected by a continuous automatic brake or which do not include a brake van under the control of a guard should be avoided; and that safety critical activities must be undertaken by an adequate number of staff holding the correct competencies.\nRAIB has also made four recommendations addressed to the Great Central Railway. These relate to: ensuring that activities which result in trains being left unattended are subject to effective risk controls; implementing the railway’s safety management system to ensure that its requirements relating to the training and assessment of staff are effective; ensuring that non-compliances and unsafe practices are detected in the future; and ensuring that the Great Central Railway has effective oversight of the maintenance being undertaken on diesel locomotives operating on its infrastructure. \n\nR042015_150521_Loughborough_Central\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Loughborough Central station\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail and 1 others/runaway_and_collision_near_to_loughborough_central_station.txt','Heavy rail and 1 others'
'\n  On Wednesday 24 May a manually propelled track trolley being used during engineering works on the Circle Line of London Underground ran away down a gradient of 1 in 70 and collided with another, stationary, trolley. A warning had been given and all staff were clear of the line. There were no injuries.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the trolley brakes failed to stop the trolley when they were applied. Causal factors were the failure to carry out prescribed checks of the trolley before use and a modification to the brake system that reduced its effectiveness. There were four factors contributing to the incident, and the underlying cause was identified as the widespread unauthorised modification of brakes allowed and encouraged by this design of trolley.\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  the design, acceptance and maintenance of track trolleys;\n  the training of Track Trolley Operators (TTOs);\n  the management of sites where track trolleys are used;\n  the reporting of incidents on the London Underground network.\n\n\nR122007-070502-Notting-Hill-Gate.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\nRAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\nRAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Notting Hill Gate \n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/runaway_trolley_at_notting_hill_gate.txt,Metros
'\n  On Sunday 29 June 2008 at approximately 23:30 hrs the middle bogie of a tram derailed and travelled 90 metres before coming to rest having partially mounted a pavement. A number of passengers suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was failure of the rail’s keep (a flange designed to prevent the road surface from fouling the wheels) allowing the wheels to move outside their guided path, and eventually to derail.\n\nThis was because of:\n\n\n  a lack of processes, and of technical criteria, within the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE - the asset owner) and Stagecoach Metrolink (the operator and maintainer) to give guidance on how to handle the track in Manchester city centre when it was in a poor condition\n  the previous contractual arrangements between GMPTE and Serco (the previous operator of the system) which allowed the city centre track to deteriorate beyond acceptable maintenance limits\n  the city centre track being allowed to continue in a poor condition as a result of neither GMPTE nor Stagecoach Metrolink implementing a programme of renewals, nor carrying out sufficient interim maintenance\n  GMPTE and Stagecoach Metrolink allowing tram traffic to continue in the city centre when the track was beyond acceptable maintenance limits\n  the contract between GMPTE and SML; the health and safety arrangements of both GMPTE Metrolink and SML.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made four recommendations targeted at the GMPTE, Stagecoach Metrolink (the operator and maintainer) and the ORR.

'\n  At approximately 03:00 hrs on 10 September 2011, a hand trolley ran unattended for a distance of 2.9 miles (4.6 km) along the Portsmouth main line near Haslemere. The incident occurred within an overnight engineering possession and there were no casualties.\n\nThe trolley operator did not know he was on a long falling gradient when he let go of the trolley and the brakes on the trolley failed to apply automatically. The brake mechanism probably jammed with the brakes in the ‘off’ position due to a combination of factors including inadequacies in the design, risk assessment and acceptance processes, and in the subsequent maintenance of the trolley.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to the training and competence of trolley operators, the product acceptance process, reviewing the actions it has taken since the incident, alternative means of communication in areas of poor mobile phone reception and the process for reviewing RAIB recommendations made to other operators. One recommendation is made to Torrent Trackside, the maintainer of the trolley, to improve the competence of its staff to maintain equipment.\n\nAs a learning point from this incident, RAIB has also identified that duty holders should have effective processes for making sure their staff are made aware of changes in the Rule Book which are relevant to the work they perform.\n\nR142012-120712-Haslemere.pdf  \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Haslemere \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/incident_near_haslemere_surrey.txt','Heavy rail'

Two of the five coaches which made up the train were derailed. The train was carrying thirty four passengers and three crew. The guard was slightly injured in the derailment due to the motion of the derailed luggage van, though no passengers were injured.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that track components had failed and allowed the wheels of the train to fall between the rails. An inspection of the track had not spotted the failed components and a track inspection that should have been carried out on foot had instead been done from a train.\n\nOther causes were that the Ffestiniog Railway Company was not following its own track inspection procedure, the track component which failed was prone to overload if sleepers had deteriorated, which in this case they had, the Company had not experienced this type of failure before, and its procedures for diagnosing track faults were inadequate.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made five recommendations aimed at the Ffestiniog Railway Company, relating to its track inspection and maintenance procedures and to change control processes for its standing instructions.\n\nR182009-090702-Gysgfa.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for derailment on the Ffestiniog Railway (Gysgfa)\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/derailment_at_gysgfa.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  On Friday 02 June 2006 a Northern Line tube train became derailed while entering the reversing siding at Archway station in north London.

'\n  On 12 May 2010, the leading wheelset of a locomotive that was hauling an engineering train derailed when it was travelling westbound between Gloucester Road and Earl’s Court stations on the Piccadilly Line of the London Underground system.\n\nAs a result of the derailment, the locomotive and infrastructure were damaged and the driver of the engineering train reported suffering from trauma. The westbound Piccadilly Line was closed between Gloucester Road and Earl’s Court stations until the start of the passenger service the following day while the locomotive was re-railed and infrastructure repairs were undertaken.\n\nThe derailment occurred because the track was not able to maintain gauge within safe limits as the train passed over it. A combination of factors led to this situation occurring, including:\n\n\n  the non-identification and misclassification of track faults which led to those faults not being rectified\n  no action being taken in response to the identification of dynamic wide gauge at the location of the derailment in the previous months\n  there were insufficient staff to maintain the track in good condition\n  the Piccadilly Line team within Tube Lines was mainly focused on managing safety faults and had not identified the safety risks from combined groups of less serious faults.\n\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations.

One of the freight wagons was subsequently found to have severe wheel flats.\n\nThe immediate cause of the broken rails was mechanical overload resulting from the impact of the damaged wheel on the rails. There were three causal factors. The underlying cause of the incident was a lack of information sharing between different parties involved, leading to no collective assessment of the risk from the flats and no mitigation.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation, designed to reduce the risk of wheel flats occurring on the line and to improve detection of these faults.\n\nR272006-061220-Urchfont.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Urchfont & Kennington \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/broken_rails_at_urchfont_and_kennington.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 16 November 2006 an engineer’s train carrying out a shunting movement entered platform 2 at Swanage and collided with a rake of carriages that were stabled there. Two members of Swanage Railway personnel were injured, though neither required hospital treatment. The locomotive and one carriage sustained damage to the buffers and surrounding bodywork.\n\nThe immediate cause of the collision was that the locomotive driver did not register the signalled route of the train when he checked the signal before starting the train move. There was one causal factor and two contributory factors to the incident, plus three observations regarding the operational safety of the Swanage Railway that did not contribute to the collision.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations as a result of its investigation, and three recommendations to address other matters observed during the investigation.

'\n  At around 02:40 hrs on 25 October 2007, an engineering unit (consisting of a motorised electric track trolley, carrying four persons, and two loaded trailers) failed to slow down at the rate the driver expected. The engineering unit was travelling at approximately 10 mph (16 km/h) from St John’s Wood station towards Baker Street station on the London Underground Jubilee southbound line. The engineering unit collided at slow speed with two manual trolleys. There were no injuries.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause which was that the emergency brake failed to slow the engineering unit at the rate expected by the Track Trolley Operator.\n\nCausal factors were that the trailer connected to the electric track trolley had non-operational emergency brakes, that the the second trailer had only 50\% operational emergency brakes, and the poor performance of the braking systems on the engineering unit. The mechanical design of the braking system of the trailers was also of a sensitive nature, which had resulted in the emergency brakes jamming in the off position on one trailer.\n\nThe RAIB has also identified contributory and underlying factors. The underlying factors are associated with the operation of on track plant on London Underground, and the acceptance and maintenance of such plant for London Underground.\n\nAs a consequence of this incident RAIB has made fourteen recommendations. These relate to the following areas:\n\n\n  the manufacturer of the vehicles, and in particular the design, maintenance, and operation of the engineering unit including the braking system of the trailers\n  the training of the staff involved\n  the design, acceptance and approvals process for on-track plant and training on London Underground Ltd’s railways\n  the reporting of the incidents by the staff involved.\n\n\nR242008-081127-StJohnsWood.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for St John’s Wood \n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/collision_near_st_john’s_wood.txt,Metros
'\n  At 08:03 hrs on 22 March 2006, two axles of a tram travelling from Bury to Altrincham became derailed as the tram entered the street running section of the Metrolink network at Long Millgate, near Victoria station. The derailed wheels remained close to the track, and the tram stopped 44 metres from the point of derailment. There were 200 passengers on board. There were no injuries and no damage to the tram; there was minor damage to the track.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the failure of a repaired section of track at the transition between two types of rail. The repair to the track had been undertaken without appropriate controls design change process or quality control of the work done, and there were contributing factors related to the design and material of the track.\n\nRAIB have made four recommendations to the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) covering the design, maintenance and renewal of the track on the Metrolink system as a result of its investigation. They concern:\n\n\n  The development and implementation of and appropriate standard for grooved rail track, including tolerances and limits for wear and gauge; and guidance to inspection staff on appropriate levels and types of intervention.\n  The assessment of the risk of transitions between flat bottomed and grooved rail on curves, and the repositioning of the transitions onto straight track where this is warranted and it is reasonably practicable to do so.\n  The introduction of system for initiating, planning and implementing track renewals.\n  Review of infrastructure design change and quality control procedures.\n\n\nR082007-070416-Long-Millgate.pdf  \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Long Millgate \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/derailment_at_long_millgate.txt','Light rail'
'\n  On 13 January 2007 at 12.23pm, an eight-car Southern train travelling from Bognor Regis to London Victoria emerged from Merstham tunnel and ran into landslip debris on the track, which derailed its leading wheelset. The driver saw the debris and applied the emergency brake to slow the train, which stopped after 320 metres. None of the 413 passengers were injured but some needed assistance to reach the public highway. The first coach received substantial damage and some signalling equipment and track bonds required replacement.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was that two timber beams from a wall intended to prevent rock and soil spills had been displaced by a six-tonne root ball falling from the cutting side. There were three causal factors and four contributory factors related to the incident. The underlying cause was the lack of guidance in standards regarding root balls, and a backlog of earthworks examinations.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations as a result of this incident.

'\n  Shortly before 07:00 hrs on Friday 13th August 2010, an engineering train ran away along part of the Northern Line of London Underground.\n\nThe train consisted of a self-propelled diesel-powered unit designed for re-profiling worn rails. It had been working between Highgate and Archway stations on the southbound line during the night of 12/13 August. At the end of grinding operations that night, the crew of the unit found that they were unable to restart its engine to travel away from the site of work.\n\nAn assisting train, consisting of a six-car train of the 1995 stock used for passenger services on the Northern line, was sent to the rescue of the grinding unit. The assisting train was coupled to the grinding unit by means of an emergency coupling device, and the braking system of the grinding unit was de-activated to allow it to be towed. The combined trains then set out to run to East Finchley station. At about 06:42 hrs, after passing through Highgate station, the coupling device fractured and the grinding unit began to run back down the gradient towards central London. The crew of the grinding unit, who had no means of re-applying the brake, jumped off the unit as it passed through Highgate station. It then ran unattended for about four miles, passing through a further six stations, and came to rest near Warren Street station about sixteen minutes later. LUL control room staff took action to clear trains away from the path of the runaway unit.\n\nNo-one was hurt. There was some damage to the grinding unit, and points at Mornington Crescent station were damaged when the unit ran through them.\n\nThe emergency coupling broke because it was not strong enough for the duties it was intended to perform, and had been inadequately designed and procured. RAIB has made seven recommendations to London Underground Ltd, covering the processes for introducing new engineering equipment, review of existing equipment, investigation of incidents, training of staff, the operation of unbraked vehicles, and the quality assurance processes used by LUL and its associated companies.\n\nR092011-110615-Highgate.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Highgate.\n\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/runaway_at_highgate.txt,Metros

'\n  On 4 January 2010, in freezing temperatures and snowy conditions, the front portion of a freight train which was travelling from Inverness towards Perth on the Highland Main Line, derailed at Carrbridge station. The derailed portion of the train came to rest on an embankment, close to some houses. The driver and technician onboard the train suffered minor injuries. Damage was caused to private property, to the derailed train and to the infrastructure of the railway.\n\nThe freight train’s braking performance prior to derailing was much reduced from that which would normally be expected. The train’s driver was unaware of this reduction prior to attempting to brake the train on the approach to Carrbridge.\n\nA combination of factors led to the derailment occurring. These included:\n\n\n  snow and ice ingress reducing the effectiveness of the train’s brakes\n  the way that the driver of the train applied the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions on steep climbing gradients\n  the train ploughing into and/or disturbing lying snow during the journey from Inverness to Carrbridge; and\n  the presence of deep lying snow close to the railway line.\n\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations. These are:\n\n\n  to freight operating companies, in conjunction with the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), concerning changes to the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions on steep climbing gradients\n  to Network Rail, relating to the assessment of risk at locations including steep gradients when trains are operating over them in snowy conditions\n  to Network Rail, relating to the assessment of risk when deep lying snow is left close to railway lines following the prolonged use of a certain type of snow clearance equipment\n  to Network Rail, concerning the assessment of risk should trains fail to stop when requested to do so at the signal controlling the approach to Carrbridge from Inverness.\n\n\nR032011-110224-Carrbridge.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Carrbridge\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_of_a_freight_train_at_carrbridge.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  A passenger was alighting from a southbound train at Tooting Broadway after the door warnings had sounded when the doors closed, trapping the hem of her coat. The train began to move before she was able to extract her coat, but the passenger was able to take the coat off, falling to the platform in the process.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause as the train operator not observing the situation on the platform as he went through the train starting process. Causal factors were:\n\n\n  the train operator not observing that all passengers were clear of the train doors before starting the train\n  the train operator focussing on the line ahead instead of monitoring the station platform on his CCTV\n  the passenger leaving the train shortly before it departed, as the alarm was sounding.\n\n\nThe investigation has established that an apparently disproportionate amount of instances of persons being dragged by closed doors occurs on the Northern Line when compared with the rest of the London Underground.\n\nLondon Underground Limited has issued a reminder to train operators of the correct procedure to be used when departing from a station, otherwise RAIB would have made a recommendation in this area.\n\nRAIB has recommended that London Underground investigates why the Northern Line experiences a greater than expected proportion of this type of incident and take any appropriate steps as a result of their investigation to reduce the rate on the Northern Line towards that on other LUL lines.\n\nR172008-080828-Tooting-Broadway.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Tooting Broadway \n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/incident_at_tooting_broadway_station.txt,Metros
'\n  On 17 January at 17:14 hrs, a tram operated by Metrolink was approaching Pomona station from the north at low speed when it derailed. The derailment was caused by the poor condition of the track, which resulted in the leading wheelset being derailed.\n\nThere were no injuries to the passengers on board. However, the crowded conditions and location of the tram caused a slight delay in their evacuation, whilst they were led along a viaduct walkway to the station platform. The tram service was suspended until 19 January 2007 to allow the tram to be recovered and the track to be repaired.\n\nContributory factors include deficiencies in track inspection and maintenance, the design of the track and the contractual framework surrounding audits and repairs of the infrastructure.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations as a result of this incident.

'\n  At about 19:00 hrs on 3 February 2014, at Holborn station in central London, a passenger was dragged about ten metres along the platform by a departing Piccadilly line train, after her scarf became caught between the closing doors of one of the carriages.\n\nThe train had stopped normally in the platform and passengers had alighted and boarded. A member of staff on the platform signalled to the train operator, by raising a baton, to begin the process of closing the train’s doors. As the train operator started to close the doors, a passenger arrived on the platform and moved towards the train, stopping as she realised that the doors were closing. As she stopped, the end of the scarf that she was wearing round her neck continued to swing towards the train and became trapped in the closing doors.\n\nThe train operator was unaware that the scarf was trapped. He started to move the train, and the passenger was dragged along the platform. The member of staff on the platform tried to help the passenger by catching hold of her, and she fell to the ground. This resulted in the scarf being forcibly removed from the passenger’s neck and carried into the tunnel by the train. The passenger suffered injuries to her neck and back, but the actions of the member of staff may have saved her from being more badly hurt.\n\nThe investigation found that the force required to remove the trapped scarf is likely to have been less than the maximum specified in the relevant London Underground standard, but it may have been difficult for a person taken by surprise and being dragged along the platform to exert such a force.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to London Underground, covering possible improvements to the means available to staff to stop trains from departing if an emergency occurs during the train despatch process.\n\nR222014-141023-Holborn.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Holborn station \n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/passenger_dragged_by_a_train_at_holborn_station.txt,Metros

'\n  At around 17:25 hrs on Saturday 7 March 2015, train reporting number 1Z67, the 16:35 hrs steam hauled charter service from Bristol Temple Meads to Southend, passed signal SN45 at danger. Signal SN45, which is situated on the approach to Wootton Bassett Junction, was being maintained at danger to protect the movement of a scheduled passenger train. At the time that the incident occurred, this scheduled passenger train had already passed through the junction. No injuries, damage or derailment occurred as a result of the incident. \n\nTrain 1Z67 was operated by West Coast Railways and consisted of the steam locomotive ‘Tangmere’ and 13 coaches. Although Tangmere is a heritage locomotive, it is fitted with modern safety systems including the Automatic Warning System (AWS) and the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS).\n\nRAIB’s investigation has found that signal SN45 was passed at danger because the driver did not reduce the train’s speed on approach to the signal. This meant that he was unable to stop the train in time, once he realised it was at danger. The driver had not reduced the train’s speed because he had not seen the preceding signal, which was at caution and should have alerted him that SN45 was at danger. He missed this preceding signal because he had become distracted by activity within the cab and possibly also because he was experiencing a higher workload than normal. \n\nTrain 1Z67 also passed signal SN45 at danger because the TPWS system was unable to reduce the speed of the train by automatically applying the brakes. This was because TPWS had been rendered ineffective by Tangmere’s crew when they had isolated the AWS system in order to by-pass an automatic brake application which had occurred at a speed restriction. Isolating AWS in this way was in contravention of the relevant rules but the RAIB has found that it had almost certainly become an accepted practice among some train crews on this locomotive. This was probably because warnings from AWS were not always apparent to drivers, who were also anxious to avoid delays resulting from brake demands. Measures intended to prevent the misuse of AWS isolations had either not been adopted by West Coast Railways or had not been effectively implemented. \n\nThe RAIB found three underlying factors. These were that the AWS system on Tangmere was installed in a way which meant that warnings from the system were not always apparent to drivers. In addition, the investigation found that a speed restriction which was in place on approach to the junction was based on incorrect information and had been implemented in a way which did not conform to the relevant rules and standards.  The investigation also found that West Coast Railways had a weak safety culture and that this had affected the way its staff observed rules and instructions.\n\nAs a result of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations. One recommendation is addressed to RSSB, working in conjunction with steam train operators and Network Rail, and relates to a review of the arrangements intended to assess, prevent and mitigate the risks associated with steam movements.  \n\nThree recommendations are addressed to West Coast Railways. These relate to a review of its safety management system and safety culture; the implementation of industry best-practice concerning the management of drivers’ knowledge of operating routes; and the arrangements for maintaining on train data recorders.  \n\nOne recommendation is addressed to Network Rail. This concerns the way that emergency and temporary speed restrictions are designed and implemented.\n\nRAIB has identified one key learning point. This is that allowing safety critical systems such as AWS and TPWS to function without improper interference is vital to the safe operation of the railway. By-passing safety systems, or isolating them other than in accordance with the requirements of the relevant rules, can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nR082016_160505_Wootton_Bassett\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Wootton Bassett Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/dangerous_occurrence_at_wootton_bassett_junction_wiltshire.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 5 July 2007 a westbound Central line train struck a roll of fire-resistant material which was lying on the track between Mile End and Bethnal Green stations. The first three bogies of the train were derailed and the driver applied the emergency brake, stopping the train after 148m. There were no serious injuries caused by the derailment, but 20 passengers received medical treatment. All 520 passengers were evacuated from the train along the tunnel to Mile End station. The derailment also caused some damage to the first two carriages of the train, to the track and to one signal.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was a roll of fire-resistant blanket, approximately 1.8m long, lying across one rail. The blanket had been stored in a passage the previous night and weighted down, but the wind from passing trains had caused it to unfurl and fall onto the line. There were four causal factors and four contributory factors related to the incident.

'\n  On 5 August 2009, at around 10:06 hrs, tram number 719, running south from Cleveleys towards Blackpool, struck a pedestrian who was crossing the tramway on a roadway crossing at Norbreck tram-stop.  The pedestrian suffered serious injuries and died in hospital around five weeks later. \n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian stepped into the path of the tram, which was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. \n\nThe causal factors which led to the accident were: the tram driver did not perceive the risk in time to stop the tram, or provide a warning in sufficient time to avoid the accident; the tram’s speed on the approach to the tram-stop and crossing was around 20 mph (32 km/h) and this was contrary to the way the driver had been trained; the tram did not stop at the tram-stop; the pedestrians were unaware of the immediate proximity of the tram, because seeing people waiting in the tram-stop shelter led them to assume that the tram would stop.  As a result, they did not look to their left again as they crossed until just before the collision.\n\nThe probable causal factors were: the tram driver’s attention was to the left-hand side approaching the crossing; the tram driver incorrectly believed that the people in the tram shelter did not want to board the tram; and it is feasible that the combination of factors relating to the way the tram was driven were caused by the driver’s inexperience. \n\nA possible contributory factor was the lack of a speed limit sign.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to Blackpool Transport Services concerning the development and documentation of a company-wide policy for the determination and application of speed limits throughout the network; and the development and documentation of an effective and consistent system to monitor compliance with speed limits among tram drivers.\n\nR092010-100603-Norbreck.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Norbreck \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/fatal_accident_at_norbreck.txt','Light rail'
'\n  On Monday 22 May a freight train was conveying a discharged nuclear flask from Willesden Brent Yard to Sizewell on a freight-only branch line. As the train crossed over Bratts Blackhouse No1 User Worked Crossing at 19 mph, it was in collision with a road vehicle. No one was injured in the collision. The train was not derailed but suffered some minor damage, and the road vehicle was also damaged.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the motorist did not stop at the designated Stop Board and drove directly onto the crossing into the path of the approaching train without looking. The main causal factors were the gates at the level crossing, which had been left open for some time and could not be closed, and the driver’s failure to look for approaching trains because he had never encountered a train at the crossing before.\n\nRAIB has made eight recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  communication of safety information to users of user worked crossings;\n  inspection and maintenance of user worked crossings;\n  improvements to Bratts Blackhouse No1 User Worked Crossing signage;\n  warning to permit the safe use of Bratts Blackhouse No1 crossing;\n  the need to preserve evidence following an accident that has been notified to the RAIB;\n  signallers’ awareness of power supply failures.\n\n\nR092007-070426-Sizewell.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.  \n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Bratts Blackhouse No 1 UWC\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_bratts_blackhouse_no_1_user_worked_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 15 September 2009, at 12:15 hrs, two trams travelling in opposite directions collided at the passing loop on the upper section of the Great Orme Tramway, Llandudno.  One person suffered minor injuries in the collision. \n\nThe immediate cause of the collision was the lower points moving under the uphill tram directing the rear of the tram into the path of the downhill tram.\n\nThe causal factors were: the wheel forces overcoming the tumbler’s holding force and changing the position of the points; the effectiveness of the holding force on the points had reduced due to wear and degradation of the points and the tumbler; that the points at the upper loop did not have a facing point lock; and the Great Orme Tramway did not routinely measure the condition of the points and the tumbler mechanism because they did not have procedures for such measurements and for associated remedial actions.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to Conwy Borough Council concerning: conducting a competent technical evaluation of the points and crossings on the Great Orme Tramway; comprehensive and competent audits carried out to identify any deficiencies associated with the operation and maintenance of the Tramway.\n\nR132010-100816-Great-Orme.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Great Orme\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/collision_on_the_great_orme_tramway.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  Shortly after 14:00 hrs on 8 January 2013, a train travelling from South Shields to St James on the Tyne and Wear Metro system experienced an electrical fault soon after it left South Gosforth station. A fire developed under the rear car of the two-car train as it came to a stand, and smoke entered the passenger accommodation. There were 45 passengers in the rear car, and they used the emergency handles to release the doors, and evacuated themselves onto the side of the line, with assistance from the driver of the train. No-one was hurt, but there was damage to the electrical equipment and wiring of the rear car, and the overhead electrical supply line parted during the fire. The accident occurred on an above-ground section of line; if it had taken place in a tunnel, the amount of smoke that was produced during the fire might have resulted in serious consequences.\n\nThe fire was caused by a fault within the line breaker case of the rear car, and was sustained because the protection system associated with the electric power supply to the train did not operate until 45 seconds after the fault started.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation addressed to the infrastructure manager and two addressed jointly to the infrastructure manager and train operator of the Tyne and Wear Metro, covering the fault in the line breaker, the radio system in use on the network, and the maintenance of the emergency door release handles on the Metro cars.\n\nR182013-130925-South-Gosforth.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for South Gosforth\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/train_fire_at_south_gosforth.txt,Metros
'\n  On 13 April 2013 between 17:33 and 17:38 hrs, a tram travelling from West Croydon to Beckenham Junction, on the London Tramlink system, departed from Lebanon Road and Sandilands tram stops with all of its doors open on the left-hand side. Some of the doors closed automatically during the journey, but one set of doors remained open throughout the incident. The incident ended when a controller monitoring the tram on CCTV noticed that it had departed from Sandilands with its doors open, and arranged for the tram to be stopped. Although there were no casualties, there was potential for serious injury.\n\nThe tram was able to move with its doors open because a fault override switch, which disables safety systems such as the door-traction interlock, had been inadvertently operated by the driver while trying to resolve a fault with the tram. The driver did not close and check the doors before departing from Lebanon Road and Sandilands partly because he was distracted from dealing with the fault, and partly because he did not believe that the tram could be moved with any of its doors open. The design of controls and displays in the driving cab contributed to the driver’s inadvertent operation of the fault override switch. Furthermore, breakdowns in communication between the driver and the passengers, and between the driver and the controller, meant that neither the driver nor the controller were aware of the problem until after the tram left Sandilands.\n\nThe RAIB has made eight recommendations. Four of these are to Tram Operations Ltd, aimed at improving the design of tram controls and displays, as well as training of staff on, and processes for, fault handling and communications. Two recommendations have been made to London Tramlink, one (in consultation with Tram Operations Ltd) relating to improving cab displays and labelling and one on enhancing the quality of the radio system on the network. One recommendation is made to all UK tram operators concerning the accidental operation of safety override switches. The remaining recommendation is to the Office of Rail Regulation regarding the provision of guidance on ergonomics principles for cab interface design.\n\nR052014-140306-Lebanon-Road.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for London Tramlink\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/tram_running_with_doors_open_on_london_tramlink.txt','Light rail'
'\n  On 20 February 2010, at around 15:49 hrs, a seven-car Meridian diesel multiple unit passenger train derailed by one axle of the fourth vehicle, while travelling on the Midland Main Line near East Langton. The train was travelling at a speed of 94 mph (151 km/h) when the derailment occurred, and it subsequently ran for a distance of approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) before it stopped. The train remained upright during the derailment and did not foul the adjacent line. There were no injuries among the 190 passengers and 5 crew who were on board the train, but there was damage to the track and the train, including loss of diesel fuel.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the complete fracture of the powered trailing axle of the leading bogie on the fourth vehicle. The fracture occurred underneath the gear-side output bearing of the final drive and was caused by this bearing stiffening up so that it could no longer rotate normally. When this happened the axle spun within the inner race of the bearing to which it is normally tightly fitted. The consequent generation of a large amount of frictional heat between the axle and bearing resulted in the axle being locally heated to a high temperature and weakened to the point it could no longer carry its normal loading.\n\nKey evidence about the condition of the bearing and its fit onto the axle was destroyed in the failure, making it impossible to determine with certainty, the precise sequence of events leading to the bearing becoming stiff in rotation. The RAIB investigation has interpreted the available evidence in order to identify the most likely cause of the failure from the possible causes. RAIB concluded that the most likely cause of the bearing failure which preceded the overheating of the axle was a loose fit between the gear-side output bearing and axle.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations. Two recommendations relate to reviewing the design and overhaul procedures for final drive gearboxes on Meridians and other rolling stock. They also cover consideration of the detection of overheating output bearings in order to mitigate risk to persons resulting from a failure of the output bearings, regardless of the cause. A third recommendation relates to the oil sampling regime used for the Meridian fleet and the fourth relates to the provision of practical, simulation based alarm handling training for drivers and train crew.\n\nR012012-120130-East-Langton.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for East Langton \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/passenger_train_derailment_near_east_langton.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 16 February 2008, a child fell from a carriage forming part of the 11:20 hrs train from Wansford to Peterborough on the Nene Valley Railway (NVR). The child sustained minor injuries. The train was travelling at approximately 20 mph (32 km/h) at the time of the incident.\n\nThe accident happened because the carriage doors are fitted with internal handles. The carriage was of Danish origin, and the NVR is the only UK operator of such carriages. The child was probably able to open both the door deadlock and slam lock handles. There were no warning signs about the risk posed by the door handles.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to NVR; the NVR have taken action. The recommendation relates to measures to reduce the risk of accidental opening of doors on their ex-Danish carriages and any others in their fleet employing internal door handles, such as modifying the handles and posting warning signs.\n\nRAIB has also notified the European Rail Agency of its findings so that other railways in Europe that might use carriages with these door handles are aware of the risks from them.\n\nR152008-080717-Orton.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Nene Valley Railway\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/incident_on_the_nene_valley_railway.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  At around 18:35 hrs on 25 August 2013, a London Underground train departing Holland Park station was brought to a halt by the first of many passenger emergency alarm activations, after smoke and a smell of burning entered the train. During the following four minutes, until the train doors still in the platform were opened by the train operator (driver), around 13 passengers, including some children, climbed out of the train via the doors at the ends of carriages.\n\nThe investigation found that rising fear spread through the train when passengers perceived little or no response from the train operator to the activation of the passenger emergency alarms, the train side-doors remained locked and they were unable to open them, and they could not see any staff on the platform to deal with the situation. Believing they were in danger, a number of people in different parts of the train identified that they could climb over the top of safety barriers in the gaps between carriages to reach the platform.\n\nA burning smell from the train had been reported when the train was at the previous station, Notting Hill Gate, and although a request had been made for staff at Holland Park station to investigate the report, the train was not held in the platform for staff to respond. A traction motor on the train was later found to have suffered an electrical fault, known as a ‘flash-over’, which was the main cause of the smoke and smell. \n\nA factor underlying the passengers’ response was the train operator’s lack of training and experience to deal with incidents involving the activation of multiple passenger emergency alarms.\n\nThe report observes that London Underground Limited (LUL) commenced an internal investigation of the incident after details appeared in the media.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations to LUL. These seek to achieve a better ergonomic design of the interface between the train operator and passenger emergency alarm equipment, to improve the ability of train operators to respond appropriately to incidents of this type, and to ensure that train operators carry radios when leaving the cab to go back into the train so that they can maintain communications with line controllers. LUL is also recommended to review the procedures for line controllers to enable a timely response to safety critical conditions on trains and to ensure continuity at shift changeover when dealing with incidents. In addition, LUL is recommended to review the training and competencies of its staff to provide a joined-up response to incidents involving trains in platforms and to reinforce its procedures on the prompt and accurate reporting of incidents so that they may be properly investigated.\n\nR162014-170728-Holland-Park.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Holland Park\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/uncontrolled_evacuation_train_holland_park_station.txt,Metros
'\n  At 14:37 hrs on Saturday 13 September 2008, a tram travelling from Wimbledon to New Addington on the London Tramlink system collided with a 21-year-old male cyclist at Morden Hall Park footpath crossing, between Morden Road and Phipps Bridge tram stops. The tram was travelling at about 62 km/h (39 mph) at the moment that it struck the cyclist, who was thrown to the ground and sustained injuries from which he later died.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the cyclist rode onto the crossing without looking at the approaching tram. Causal factors were that the cyclist may have been wearing headphones which prevented him hearing the audible warnings sounded by the tram driver, and that the layout of the approach to the crossing did not encourage cyclists to look towards eastbound trams.\n\nThe investigation found that a possible contributory factor was that the risks created by the way in which Morden Hall Park and other foot crossings on the London Tramlink system were being used had not been assessed by the infrastructure manager since the tramway opened.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made one recommendation targeted at Tramtrack Croydon Ltd (trading as London Tramlink), the owner and infrastructure manager, to modify footpath crossings on their system where appropriate.\n\nFollowing the accident, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) issued an Improvement Notice requiring Tramtrack Croydon Ltd to assess the risks to users at footpath crossings on its system, and identify any further actions required to reduce risk. The assessment was carried out by the date set for compliance, 14 January 2009, and Tramtrack Croydon Ltd has drawn up a programme of works for improvements at some of the crossings.\n\n \nR062009-090312-MordenHallPark.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Morden Hall Park \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/fatal_accident_at_morden_hall_park_footpath_crossing.txt','Light rail'
'\n  At 1:30am on 5 December 2007, a road-rail vehicle (RRV) hauling a loaded trailer was unable to stop as it approached a work site where rock face repairs were taking place. Several site staff narrowly avoided injury by jumping clear. Although a low-speed collision occurred between the RRV and another RRV at the site, staff were not injured.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified a number of immediate causal factors:\n\n\n  the RRV’s trailer was not fitted with brakes adequate to stop it on the gradient \n  there were poor weather conditions\n  it was likely there were wood chippings on the track. \n\n\nThere were also a number of contributory factors, including:\n\n\n  Network Rail did not advise their contractor of the gradient at the site \n  the machine operator was not aware of the risk of rail contamination from other work going on at the site\n  the machine was travelling too fast\n  the road tyres of the vehicle were not inflated to the correct pressure\n  the operator’s training did not cover how to deal with a braking emergency.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made seven recommendations targeted at Network Rail and the companies who own or operate road-rail vehicles. These include:\n\n\n  providing briefing information for road-rail vehicle operators \n  putting in place competence systems and management for road-rail vehicle operators \n  the provision of a risk assessment for RRVs \n  the provision of service brakes on road-rail vehicle trailers\n\n\n \nR052009-090225-Glen-Garry.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Glen Garry\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/runaway_at_glen_garry.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On Thursday 08 June a Midland Metro tram collided with a taxi on New Swan Lane level crossing. The taxi was pushed across the junction and collided with a stationary lorry. The two occupants of the taxi were taken to hospital with minor injuries, while the tram and both road vehicles suffered minor damage in the collision.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the tram driver failing to stop at the signal, anticipating it would change before the tram reached the crossing. A contributory factor was the driver’s decision not to apply the hazard brake when realising the signal was unlikely to change. The underlying cause behind this decision was the view amongst drivers that use of the hazard brake was discouraged by the organisation. In addition, a lack of familiarity with the performance of the hazard brake and previous briefing on the possibility of causing injury to passengers and damage to the tram contributed to the driver’s decision.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  reviewing the driver training programme; and\n  reviewing the arrangements for reporting and follow up on use of the hazard brake.\n\n\nR182007-070607-Swan-Lane.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses. \n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for New Swan Lane \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/collision_at_new_swan_lane_level_crossing.txt','Light rail'
'\n  At around 07:06 hrs on 28 June 2012, a passenger train scheduled to operate between Belfast and Portrush, ran onto a section of washed-out embankment near Knockmore on the Antrim branch line. The driver applied the emergency brake when he became aware of the hazard but was unable to stop the train before the leading bogie ran over the unsupported rails at the washout. The train came to a stand with the bogies of the leading vehicle either side of the washout. The train did not derail and was subsequently reversed away. There were no injuries.\n\nThe RAIB investigation found that the following factors led to the incident:\n\n\n  heavy rainfall in the area during the previous evening;\n  a system of culverts at and downstream of the washout could not cope with the water flows generated by the rainfall, causing localised flooding;\n  the embankment could not withstand the differential water levels that built up across it;  \n  the train was sent onto the Antrim branch line without any additional precautions, despite the heavy rainfall; and\n  the driver was unable to see the washout in time to be able to stop the train before it.\n\n\nTwo underlying factors were identified:\n\n\n  there was no engagement between Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) and the Rivers Agency regarding the potential for flooding due to heavy rainfall at the incident site; and\n  NIR’s weather preparedness procedure did not include a plan for dealing with flooding or heavy rainfall.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the incident, the RAIB has made five recommendations to NIR. The first relates to a review of earthworks and structures with respect to flood risk, including the development of a formalised liaison process with the Rivers Agency for the dissemination of relevant information. The second relates to the development of procedures to maintain safety of the line during and following adverse weather conditions.

On Wednesday 5 July, the leading bogie of the fifth coach of a different locomotive-hauled passenger train derailed at Millwood Bank. There were no injuries or significant damage to the track in either incident.\n\nThe immediate cause of the Spout House Curve derailment was flange climb of the leading right wheel, due to the combination of a vehicle fault and the track condition. There were two causal, several contributory and one underlying factor to the derailment.\n\nThe immediate cause of the Millwood Bank derailment was flange climb of the leading right wheel, due to a combination of vehicle, track and operational factors, which resulted in an excessive amount of vehicle sway and wheel unloading. There were three causal, three contributory and one underlying factor to the derailment.\n\nRAIB has made eight recommendations as a result of its investigation these include:\n\n\n  a fleet check of axlebox clearances and its inclusion in ongoing maintenance practice;\n  development and implementation of a vehicle maintenance regime which is based on the assessment of hazards identified from both past experience and analysis of possible future failure modes;\n  review of the suspension set up on the type of bogie involved in the derailment at Millwood Bank, to ensure it is consistent with the track condition;\n  examination of the track to identify current and likely future areas of poor condition and remedial work where necessary, particularly with regard to voiding below sleepers;\n  review of the existing track fault reporting system and the reaction to reported faults and mandating of the system;\n  implementation of a system to identify track faults liable to cause excessive sway and when mitigation measures should be triggered;\n  briefing of operational staff on the signs of and risk from excessive vehicle sway.\n\n\nR072007-070327-RER.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/derailments_on_the_ravenglass_&_eskdale_railway.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  At around 09:55 hrs on 12 April 2012, a passenger became trapped in one of the doors of a train at Jarrow station. The passenger had arrived on the platform as the doors were closing and had placed her arm in the path of the closing door. The closing doors trapped her arm, and a few seconds later, as the train left the station, the passenger was forced to run alongside it. A timely activation of the emergency door release by a passenger inside the train allowed the passenger to free herself and she fell onto the platform. The passenger left the station immediately. CCTV evidence suggests that she did not sustain significant injuries.\n\nThe RAIB investigation found that, in addition to the passenger’s actions, the following factors led to the incident:\n\n\n  there was a fault condition on the set of doors involved in the incident which, with the arm trapped, not only disabled the obstruction detection system and prevented the door reopening, but also enabled the driver to release the train brakes and apply traction power\n  the passenger was unable to pull her trapped arm out of the door\n  the driver of the train did not notice the trapped passenger in the few seconds between closing the doors and leaving the station.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations, which cover:\n\n\n  measures to reduce and monitor the number of deliberate door obstructions\n  improvements to the reliability of the door control circuits\n  improving driver’s visibility of the platform/train interface at stations\n  changing the method used to test door obstacle extraction forces to one that is aligned with the intentions of the relevant Railway Group Standard\n  clarifying Railway Group Standard GM/RT2473, which specifies how to test door obstacle extraction forces.\n\n\nR262012-121203-Jarrow.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Jarrow station \n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/passenger_incident_at_jarrow_station.txt,Metros
'\n  At approximately 09:44 hrs on Wednesday 16 May 2012, a pedestrian was struck by a tram as she crossed the tramway on a foot crossing on the approach to Sandilands tram stop in Croydon. The impact resulted in the pedestrian falling into the space between the platform and the tram. She remained trapped in that position as the tram continued into the platform and suffered serious injuries.\n\nThe investigation found that the pedestrian had not looked for an approaching tram before she crossed. However, there was a possible obstruction to the pedestrian’s view of approaching trams as she walked towards the entrance to the tram stop and the configuration of the crossing meant that she approached it with her back to trams running on the nearest track.\n\nRisk assessments had been undertaken in relation to safety at Sandilands foot crossing (and other foot crossings on the Croydon tram network) in 2008/9 and 2011. The investigation found that methodology employed in the 2008/9 assessment was not a suitable basis for prioritising the foot crossings for safety improvements. With the agreement of the Office of Rail Regulation, London Tramlink mainly prioritised crossings remote from tram stops for safety improvements from 2009 onwards. The 2011 risk assessment, while intended for the purpose of assessing whether the track at tram stops should be filled in between the rails, also identified that the foot crossing at Sandilands represented the highest risk of the 52 crossings that were considered in the review. London Tramlink did not make any safety improvements to reduce the probability of a pedestrian being struck on the foot crossing at Sandilands in response to the findings. Although London Tramlink had taken some action to help it understand the generality of the risk at foot crossings on its network, and had introduced a speed restriction of 25 km/h for trams passing over foot crossings on the approach to all tram stops, its processes for managing the risk at individual crossings were not effective.\n\nThe investigation also found that two factors affected the consequences of the accident. Firstly, the tram driver did not apply the hazard brake (which achieves a higher rate of retardation than the brake normally employed for stopping trams) after the tram struck the pedestrian. Secondly, there was enough vertical and horizontal clearance to create a survival space for the pedestrian in the position where she fell after the accident.\n\nThe RAIB has made five recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to London Tramlink in relation to risk assessment at foot crossings, processes for ensuring pedestrians have clear sight of approaching trams and improving organisational competence in safety decision-making. One recommendation has been made jointly to London Tramlink and Tram Operations Ltd in relation to investigation of accidents and incidents. One recommendation has been made to the Office of Rail Regulation in relation to reissuing guidance on various aspects of the design of tram stops and foot crossings. \n\nThe RAIB has also identified a learning point for tram operators regarding use of the hazard brake when a tram has struck a pedestrian.\n\nR032013-130214-Sandilands.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Sandilands, Croydon\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/pedestrian_struck_by_a_tram_at_sandilands_tram_stop.txt','Light rail'
'\n  On Tuesday 21 February 2006 a freight train travelling from Crewe to Toton, near Nottingham, contained 14 wagons which had unsecured loads of redundant track panels. Although the unsecured load remained in place throughout the journey, there was potential for it to move or be shed, which could have resulted in a serious incident.\n\nThe train was dispatched onto the mainline railway with an incorrect consist of wagons.

'\n  A passenger train consisting of a former Great Western Railway (GWR) steam tank locomotive, propelling a GWR autocoach, left Norchard station on the Dean Forest Railway (DFR) at 14:40 hrs on Wednesday 15 August 2007.\n\nThe train approached and struck the partially open northern secondary gate at Lydney Town level crossing. The train continued through the crossing before being brought to a stand alongside Lydney Town station platform.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the driver of the train was unable to stop the train and struck the crossing gates.\n\nA causal factor was the excessive speed of the train, and contributory factors were the wet condition of the rails following recent heavy rain, the locomotive crew’s lack of training and experience in controlling this type of train in these conditions, the failure of equipment that warned the level crossing operators that a train was approaching, and the lack of any system for informing the train crew that this equipment was not working.\n\nOther possible contributory factors were the lack of working equipment on the train to lay sand on the rails, noise from road traffic at the level crossing and pressure on the DFR to minimise delays to road users.\n\nRAIB has made ten recommendations, all targeted at the DFR. The recommendations concern the speed of trains approaching Lydney Town level crossing, adherence to speed restrictions; braking and sanding systems on the Dean Forest Railway; procedures for operating the Dean Forest Railway safely in a degraded mode; maintenance of treadles to a recognised standard; knowledge and experience of footplate crews; appointment of a health and safety adviser; notification of accidents; and age-related standards for train drivers.\n\nThe DFR has already taken action to address many of these recommendations, by bringing into use sanding equipment on its trains, providing additional training for locomotive crews, making changes to the warning system at the level crossing, and appointing a qualified person to act as health and safety director.\n\nR142008-080702-Lydney.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Lydney Town level crossing\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heritage railways/collision_lydney_town_level_crossing.txt','Heritage railways'
'\n  At around 18:56 hrs on 11 August 2014, a Tyne and Wear Metro train at Walkergate station, developed an electrical fault in equipment under the rear car, which tripped the power supply to the overhead wire. About a minute later, the power was remotely restored by a power controller and a fire started in the faulty equipment. The fault drew a high current from the overhead wire through the car’s pantograph, causing localised overheating and, after about 18 seconds, the wire parted. The loose ends of the live wire flailed around the train roof, showering sparks, and one end fell on the platform. A second power controller happened to observe events on station CCTV and power to the overhead line was disconnected. The parted overhead wire had remained live for approximately 14 seconds. \n\nAt the time of the accident, the train doors were closed for departure and there were no passengers on the platform. About 30 passengers got out of the train after the power was turned off. There were no reported injuries, although passengers were evidently distressed. \n\nA sustained high current was drawn because the electrical fault occurred in a part of the train’s power circuit which was not protected by on-train equipment and which could only be detected by the overhead power supply protection equipment. However, because of the way that the power was switched back on, the level of current drawn by the fault was not sufficient to immediately activate that protection. The underlying cause of the accident was the ineffective management of risks created at the interface between system components, comprising the power supply, power control and the train. \n\nRAIB observed that the arrangements between the infrastructure operator, Nexus, and the train operator, DB Regio Tyne and Wear, did not effectively facilitate the sharing of relevant health and safety information on risks created within the system. It also observed deficiencies in the competence management of the power control function and in the regime for assuring the continued integrity of some electrical protection equipment.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations. The first, addressed to Nexus, seeks improvements in its safety management system to provide a more effective framework for the management of its shared risks. The second, addressed to both Nexus and DB Regio Tyne and Wear, relates to the identification and evaluation of risks created at the interfaces between their organisations. The third recommendation, addressed to both organisations, seeks to achieve more comprehensive power control procedures to facilitate safe decision-making.\n\nR092015_150730_Walkergate\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Walkergate station\n\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/parting_of_live_overhead_wire_at_walkergate.txt,Metros
'\n  On 29 January 2007, the centre bogie of a tram became derailed at points on the approach to Birmingham Snow Hill terminus. There were no injuries and no significant damage to the infrastructure as a result of the derailment.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the interaction between the tram wheel and the switch tip, causing the wheel to climb onto the top of the rail. Causal factors were the left-hand switch rail not being restored to the correct geometry following repair, and the tram’s left-hand wheels being biased towards this rail. A contributory factor was the switch blade not being subject to an appropriate inspection after repair. Underlying causes were the lack of staff with sufficient competence to inspect and maintain the points adequately, and insufficiently prescriptive standards and procedures.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of this incident.

'\n  At 02:27 hrs on 3 February 2012, an electric locomotive that was being driven from Crewe to Wembley, on the West Coast Main Line, derailed as it negotiated the diverging route at Bletchley Junction. The locomotive was travelling at a speed of 65.5 mph (105.4 km/h) when it derailed: the speed limit for the diverging route was 15 mph (24 km/h). The driver received minor injuries and significant damage was caused to the underside of the locomotive, the track and the overhead electrification equipment.\n\nThe driver of the locomotive correctly reduced its speed on the approach to the red signal before the junction but when this changed to green, with an ‘F’ indication meaning that the locomotive was to take the diverging route, the driver applied full power in the belief that he was going straight on. It is likely that the driver only realised that he was to take the diverging route around the time he was passing the signal, by which time it was too late to prevent the derailment.\n\nRAIB found that the driver did not immediately observe and/or register what was displayed by the signal’s route indicator even though he understood its meaning. This was despite the fact that the approach view of the route indicator was found to be satisfactory, free of obstructions and with sufficient time for a driver to see and understand its meaning. RAIB has concluded that the driver’s belief that he was continuing on the up slow line overcame the fact that the ‘F’ indication was clearly visible to him.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to Virgin Trains covering the training and assessment of drivers’ route knowledge, and two recommendations to Network Rail. The first of these relates to the assessment of the risk from overspeeding at diverging junctions when the signal before the junction clears from red to a proceed indication, and the second relates to clarifying the status of the Weekly Operating Notice, an operating publication which is issued to drivers, and which contained information about engineering work south of Bletchley requiring trains to take the diverging route at Bletchley Junction.\n\nR242012-121121-Bletchley-Junction.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bletchley Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_bletchley_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Saturday 25 August 2007 a train on the Leighton Buzzard Railway collided with a tractor at low speed on Cavalry Horse User Worked Crossing, on the outskirts of Leighton Buzzard. One passenger was slightly injured, and damage was caused to the locomotive and the tractor.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the tractor driving onto the crossing when a train was approaching. Causal factors were the inadequate visibility for road vehicles and the lack of recent vegetation cutting at the crossing, and a contributory factor was the lack of briefing for the owner of the field. The underlying cause was the Leighton Buzzard Railway’s lack of understanding of the need to assess and maintain visibility for road users on farm crossings.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations aimed at Leighton Buzzard Railway.

'\n  On Saturday 29 April, at 23:09 a District Line train with approximately 150 passengers on board left Earls Court for High Street Kensington. As the train approached High Street Kensington, the driver realised that the wrong route had been set and stopped the train. A “Wrong Direction Move” (WDM) was authorised to reverse the train a short distance so the route could be reset. However, the train did not stop at the authorised limit of the reversal, and was halted by the traction current being turned off. Once the traction current was recharged, the train then travelled to High Street Kensington and terminated 67 minutes late.\n\nUnder slightly different circumstances this could have resulted in a collision with another train travelling in the opposite direction. However, with the protective measures taken during the incident the risk of such a collision was exceedingly low. There were no passenger injuries or damage to trains or infrastructure as a result of the incident.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the failure to correctly locate and identify the position of a signal during a WDM, resulting in the train reversing beyond the limit of the move. There were three causal factors and eight contributory factors to the incident. The underlying causes were inadequate managerial supervision of operating practices at Earls Court Control Room and at High Street Kensington station, and inadequate managerial understanding of the essential knowledge for staff operating in this area.\n\nRAIB has made fourteen recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  the rules, procedures and working practices of LUL staff;\n  the training and briefing of LUL staff;\n  the operation of LUL stations and control rooms; and\n  the implementation of the Connect Radio project.\n\n\nR192007-070621-High-St-Ken.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.  \n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for High Street Kensington\n\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/unauthorised_train_movement_at_high_street_kensington.txt,Metros

'\n  At around 08:00 hrs on Thursday 12 March 2015, a passenger fell beneath a train after being dragged along the northbound platform of Clapham South station, in south London. She was dragged because her coat had become trapped between the closing doors of a London Underground Northern line train.\n\nThe train had stopped and passengers had alighted and boarded normally, before the driver confirmed that the door closure sequence could begin. The train operator, in the driving cab, started the door closure sequence but, before the doors had fully closed, one set encountered an obstruction and the doors were reopened. A passenger who had just boarded, and found that the available standing space was uncomfortable, stepped back off the train and onto the platform, in order to catch the following train. The edge of this passenger’s coat was then trapped when the doors closed again and she was unable to free it.\n\nThe trapped coat was not large enough to be detected by the door control system and the train operator, who was unaware of the situation, started the train moving. While checking the platform camera views displayed in his cab, the train operator saw unusual movements on the platform and applied the train brakes. Before the train came to a stop, the trapped passenger fell to the ground and then, having become separated from her coat, fell into the gap between the platform and the train. The train stopped after travelling about 60 metres. The passenger suffered injuries to her arm, head and shoulder, and was taken to hospital. \n\nAs a result of this accident, RAIB has made one recommendation, addressed to London Underground, seeking further improvements in the processes used to manage risks at the platform-train interface.\n\nRAIB has also identified one learning point for the railway industry, relating to the provision of under platform recesses as a measure to mitigate the consequences of accidents where passengers fall from the platform.\n\nR042016_160309_Clapham_South\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Clapham South\n\n',/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Metros/serious_accident_at_clapham_south_tube_station.txt,Metros

There were no injuries and the passengers were evacuated to the adjacent tram stop by the driver and other staff. Following repairs to minor track damage, normal services were reinstated at 21.10 hrs on the same day.\n\nThe immediate cause was the tram driver not reacting to a track-side warning that the points were incorrectly set and failing to stop the tram before reaching the points.\n\nContributing factors were:\n\n\n  failure of the points to return to normal after the passage of the previous tram;\n  failure of the control room staff to alert drivers to the malfunction of the points;\n  the poor clarity of the points position indicator display when the points are not set correctly.\n\n\nFour recommendations are made to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of this incident.

'\n  Early on the morning of 23 September 2011, the crew of an engineering train passing through Balcombe tunnel observed that part of a large steel structure mounted in the roof of the tunnel, spanning over both railway tracks, was sagging down. An emergency inspection found that on one side of the structure, three supports had become detached from the tunnel lining leaving a 12 metre length partially supported.\n\nThe structure, one of six within the tunnel, was intended to catch water dripping from the tunnel roof. It was supported by anchor studs fixed with polyester resin into holes drilled in the tunnel’s brick lining. Within the tunnel, 18 studs (5\%) were found to be missing and a further five studs were loose. The RAIB’s investigation has found that this connection was inadequate because the resin was not compatible with the tunnel brickwork and may have been adversely affected by shrinkage and the damp conditions in the tunnel. It is probable that the resin was selected using inadequate technical data and probable that insufficient resin was placed around some studs. Although some railway staff were aware that studs had fallen from the structure on more than one occasion since 2008, this did not result in appropriate risk mitigation. This was because of inadequacies in the reporting of these events and because there was insufficient support for a member of railway staff who was managing some aspects of the tunnel maintenance but had limited experience. Inadequate access for tunnel examinations due to conflicting demands on the limited available access is considered to be an underlying factor.\n\nRAIB has identified three learning points from this incident: the need to consider the adequacy of information contained in manufacturer’s data sheets; the need to maintain awareness of published information; and the benefit of marking significant tunnel defects such that they are visible from track level.\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations addressed to Network Rail that focus on managing existing polyester resin connections and controlling the future use of this material; confirming the compatibility of materials during design work; effective responses to defects and abnormal events; competency of staff managing structures; access for examining structures; the examination process for structures in tunnels; and retention of records relating to structures.\n\nR132013-130815-Balcombe-Tunnel.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Balcombe Tunnel\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/partial_failure_of_a_structure_inside_balcombe_tunnel.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On  17 February 2012 at about 06:23 hrs, a westbound tram derailed after passing over facing points as it approached the platform at East Croydon. The tram was running one minute behind the tram ahead, and was routed left to follow it towards platform 3. As the tram travelled forwards at low speed, the points moved under its leading bogie, forcing its centre and rear bogies right towards platform 2. The centre bogie derailed as the routes diverged. Approximately 100 passengers were detrained close to the platform. There were no reported injuries.\n\nThe main cause of this accident was that a track circuit failed to respond to an approaching tram and lock the points to prevent movement.

'\n  At approximately 03:10 hrs on 31 May 2013, a car driver was forced to take action in order to avoid colliding with an engineering train that was traversing Balnamore automatic half barrier level crossing, which is located between Coleraine and Ballymoney stations on Northern Ireland Railways’ Belfast to Londonderry/Derry line. The car subsequently struck metal fencing forming part of the crossing, causing minor injuries to its two occupants and damage to the car. The crew of the engineering train spoke with the car driver and then continued work without reporting the accident.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the engineering train was undertaking weed-spraying operations within a possession of the line, which meant that operation of passenger trains on the line had been suspended. Because the line was under possession, Balnamore level crossing, which is normally automatically operated by approaching trains, was being operated manually via its local controls. However, as the train passed over the crossing, its half barriers had not been lowered and its road traffic signals were not operating, even though this was required by the railway rules relating to this type of level crossing. This meant that the car driver did not have enough warning to stop his car before the level crossing became occupied by the train.\n\nThe RAIB has found that the team responsible for undertaking weed-spraying was routinely not complying with the rules relating to the operation of automatic half barrier level crossings within possessions. This was probably due to a combination of factors, including the team possibly having a low perception of the risks presented by this non-compliance and a desire by them to complete the weed-spraying more quickly. In addition, the team may have been influenced by the status of rules relating to the local control of other types of crossing in possessions and the method of work adopted at level crossings during a recent project.\n\nThe RAIB has also found that this non-compliance was not detected or corrected by safety checks conducted by Northern Ireland Railways. In addition, the investigation identified that the appointment of additional competent staff to operate crossings within the possession may have prevented the accident from occurring.\n\nThe RAIB has identified three key learning points. These are: that the person in charge of a possession should correctly complete the form intended to help them keep track of level crossings; that boarding moving trains, where it is prohibited, should be avoided; and that accidents should be reported.\n\nThe RAIB has also made three recommendations addressed to Northern Ireland Railways. These relate to: ensuring that activities undertaken at level crossings within possessions are subject to effective risk controls; ensuring that method statements relating to track engineering are supported by risk assessments; and increasing the opportunities for non-compliances to be detected and corrected.\n\nR102014-140512-Balnamore.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Balnamore\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_balnamore_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 15 June 2007 at about 3.50pm, a man attempted to board an eastbound tram at the Wellesley Road stop on the Croydon Tramlink. His hand or clothing appeared to have been trapped in tram doors, and when it moved off he had to run alongside it for about 15 metres before he could move away.\n\nThe tram stopped before it was clear of the platform. The man received no apparent injury and left the scene; he has not been traced.\n\nThe cause of the accident was that neither the tram driver nor the instructor reacted to the presence of the man with his hand or clothing apparently stuck between the tram doors as it moved off.\n\nThe perception of a split of responsibility between the driver and the instructor may have contributed to the lack of a final check on the platform before the tram moved off.\n\nRAIB has not made any recommendations in relation to this incident, but the tram operator, Tram Operations Ltd, has briefed staff on the correct procedure for moving away from tram stops.\n\n \n\nR402007-071121-WellesleyRoad.pdf \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/incident_at_wellesley_road.txt','Light rail'
'\n  At 09:31 hrs on 6 August 2012, train 2W06, the 09:25 hrs service from Nottingham to Worksop, struck and seriously injured an off-track inspector on the up-down Mansfield line near to Bulwell station, in Nottingham. At the time of the accident, the off-track inspector was undertaking an inspection of lineside vegetation on foot.\n\nThe off-track inspector was struck by the train because he was standing too close to the track. His awareness of where he was standing had become reduced as he was focused on determining his location. It may also have become reduced because he needed to concentrate on some elements of the inspection.\n\nBecause the off-track inspector was working on a line open to railway traffic, he had implemented a pre-planned system of work to protect himself from train movements. However, this system of work was unsuitable for the location and task being undertaken. Had the most appropriate type of system of work been planned and implemented, then the accident would have been avoided. The off-track inspector did not realise that the system he was using was unsuitable during the inspection, probably due to the way in which it was implemented. He had also not realised it was unsuitable when the system was issued to him prior to the inspection; this was because the information provided to help him check that it was appropriate did not effectively highlight why it was unsuitable.\n\nThis system of work was issued to the off-track inspector because the planner who had prepared it was unfamiliar with the location. Information provided to support her decisions about which type of system to use either did not effectively highlight its unsuitability or was found by her to be impracticable to use given her workload.\n\nIn addition, it had become normal practice within the off-track section to plan and implement the least protective type of system of work for undertaking vegetation inspections. This was, in part, because the section only had a limited range of systems to choose from, but probably also because there was an informal agreement within the section to adopt this practice, which contravened the requirements of Network Rail’s standards. Senior managers were unaware that this had occurred as they were provided with inaccurate safety monitoring data. The increased workload of planners within off-track sections was also identified as a factor in the accident.\n\nThe RAIB has identified two key learning points. These are: that the relevant Network Rail standard should be observed during the planning, approval and verification of systems of work; and that any incident where a train has struck something whilst passing persons working on or near the line should be initially treated as an accident.\n\nThe RAIB has also made five recommendations addressed to Network Rail. These relate to: the provision of information to staff about which systems of work have been found to be appropriate for given locations; the monitoring of which system of work types are being used; the resources available within off-track sections to plan and approve systems of work; how previous measures taken by Network Rail to improve the management of systems of work were implemented; and the provision of information to staff regarding the required warning times when working alone.\n\nR202013-131003-Bulwell.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bulwell \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/track_worker_struck_by_a_train_at_bulwell.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  This report covers three separate incidents. They were all associated with an abnormal method of operating the tramway. Single line working was taking place over a distance of about one mile because of line closure for track repairs. It was necessary for southbound trams to change direction twice at each end of this section to reach the opposite track.\n\nThe first incident occurred on Monday 21 November 2005 at Talbot Square. Tram 644, travelling south, was leaving the single line section. The driver had just started the tram when the controller handle became detached. The driver was unable to replace the handle, and so he attempted to apply the emergency brake. This failed to act and the tram, which was not under power, continued to roll downhill, until the gradient levelled out and it came to a stop.\n\nThe second incident was on Saturday 3 December 2005 at Gynn Square. The driver of tram 646, travelling south, left his cab to change ends for the reversal at the start of single line working. As he was walking through the tram it began to move and struck the barrier protecting the track repair works after rolling 5 metres. The driver then applied the emergency brake and the tram stopped.\n\nThe third incident occurred on Saturday 10 December 2005, also at Gynn Square, and again involved tram 646. After completion of the reversing manoeuvre, the driver moved the tram forward a short distance, some 10 metres and then attempted to stop to allow a member of staff to alight. The tram did not respond to a service brake application, so the driver applied the emergency brake and the tram stopped.\n\nA different driver was involved in each incident.\n\nThe immediate cause of the first incident was the poor condition of the tram controller housing.\n\nThe immediate cause of the second and third incidents was the design of the tram controller housing.\n\nThere were several contributing factors for each of the incidents, which are detailed in the full report.\n\nDuring our investigation, Blackpool Transport Services identified and discussed four measures with RAIB. All of them have now been implemented. They cover:\n\n\n  Full briefing of drivers about the correct procedure when changing ends\n  Lagging of air pipes to reduce the risk of the braking system freezing\n  A modification to the controller end cover\n  A review of inspection and maintenance procedures for the controllers.\n\n\nR052006-060328-Blackpool.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for runaway incidents on Blackpool Transport Services tramway\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/runaway_incidents_on_blackpool_transport_services_tramway.txt','Light rail'

'\n  On Tuesday 19 December Midland Metro trams 09 and 10, both returning from Wolverhampton St. Georges to Birmingham Snow Hill, collided near the Soho Benson Road tram stop. Passengers and staff sustained minor injuries as a result of the collision, with thirteen passengers taken to hospital although all were discharged the same day. Both trams sustained damage to their cabs.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that tram 10 failed to stop short of tram 09, which was stationary due to a technical fault. Causal factors were tram 10’s driver failing to modify driving technique while dazzled by low-lying winter sun, and the driver applying the train’s hazard brake too late. Contributing factors were tram 10’s driver having reduced visibility because of the sun, the driver being occupied with adjusting a sunblind that would not remain in position, and that procedures did not require failed trams to display hazard lights while causing an obstruction.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  the design and maintenance of tram sunblinds;\n  the use of hazard warning lights on failed trams; and\n  an assessment of Midland Metro’s off-street tram operation.\n\n\nR172007-070607-BensonRoad.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.  \n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Soho Benson Road\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/collision_at_soho_benson_road.txt','Light rail'
'\n  At around 17:35 hrs on 8 January 2006, a cyclist suffered a serious injury as a result of the passage of a Northern Rail service from York to Leeds via Harrogate at Scate Moor bridleway crossing, between Cattal and Knaresborough.\n\nThe cyclist is the only person who was at the time aware of the accident. He has been unable to recall the period between approaching the slope and when the train was passing.\n\nNo failings that could contributed to the accident have been found relating to the railway infrastructure (including the crossing), the train, its operation or the signalling.\n\nTherefore we make no recommendations in respect to this accident.\n\nR062006-060615-Scate-Moor.pdf\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/serious_injury_at_scate_moor_bridleway_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 19:00 hrs on 28 November 2012, a young person who was using the crossing over the tramway at Bayles and Wylies crossing, Bestwood, Nottingham was struck and fatally injured by a tram that was travelling at 70 km/h (43 mph).\n\nThe young person moved into the path of the tram as it approached the crossing and appeared to be unaware of the tram’s approach. The RAIB has been unable to positively establish why she seemingly did not see and react to the approaching tram or respond to the horn. Apart from a break of 0.3 seconds, this was sounded continuously as she walked towards and onto the tram track.\n\nClosed-circuit television coverage from the front of the tram indicates that she did not look towards the tram after she entered the crossing through a chicane on its west side. However, there is no clear evidence to indicate what actions she took at the chicane; it is possible that she may not have looked towards the approaching tram, or looked but not seen it. Furthermore, although there is no direct evidence, it can not be ruled out that she saw the tram approaching and thought that she had enough time to cross, or that it would stop or slow down.\n\nBayles and Wylies crossing consisted of two separately managed crossings of the Nottingham tramway and a parallel Network Rail route. Network Rail closed the crossing in February 2013 pending the construction of a footbridge to replace it. This obviated the need for the RAIB to make any recommendations to improve the crossing.\n\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations. These cover the manner in which persons in the path of a tram are audibly warned; the marking of the boundary of pedestrian crossings of tramways; the prompts to pedestrians to look for approaching trams; and the best means to illuminate pedestrian crossings to avoid glare that could affect the ability of pedestrians to detect approaching trams.\n\nR192013-130926-Bayles-and-Wylies.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bayles and Wylies\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Light rail/fatal_accident_at_bayles_and_wylies_footpath_crossing.txt','Light rail'
'\n  At about 12:10 hrs on 3 June 2015, one wagon of an empty freight train derailed on the approach to Angerstein Junction, near Charlton in south east London. The train continued over the junction, derailing two further wagons, before it stopped on the Blackheath to Charlton line. The three derailed wagons were partly obstructing the line used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. No other trains were involved in the accident and no-one was injured, but there was significant damage to the railway infrastructure.\n\nThe wagons derailed because the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient load to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track. The insufficient load was due to a combination of the suspension on that wheel being locked in one position, a twisted bogie frame and an intended twist in the track.\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made three recommendations. The first, addressed to VTG (the wagon owner), seeks improvements to its wagon maintenance processes. The second, also addressed to VTG, seeks liaison with industry to improve understanding of how wagon suspension wear characteristics relate to maintenance processes. The third, addressed to Network Rail, seeks a review of infrastructure arrangements at the accident location.\n\nThe report also includes a learning point reinforcing a previous recommendation intended to encourage use of currently available wheel load data to enable identification of wagons with defects or uneven loads that are running on Network Rail’s infrastructure.\n\nR102016_160601_Angerstein \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_near_angerstein_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 23 April 2006 a Northern Ireland Railways engineering train, consisting of a tamper towing a ballast regulator, partially derailed at Trooperslane level crossing. The torque arm of the ballast regulator, which had become partially detached, hit the road surface panels of the crossing, and caused the derailment of the ballast regulator. The tamper did not derail, but there was damage to the track and level crossing itself.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the torque arm lifting the ballast regulator off the track. The sole causal factor was the omission of a split pin from the upper torque arm securing pin. Contributory factors were the lack of a check process on the security of the torque arm, and the lack of a cross reference to the operations manual. The underlying cause of the derailment was the designed installation of two bolts where the torque arm meets the headstock of the regulator, where a single failure could cause catastrophic results.\n\nRAIB has made eight recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\n\n\n  maintenance and operational issues including training and incident management on Northern Ireland Railways\n  access for the manufacturer of the regulator to the National Incident Room reporting system for the mainland of Great Britain.\n\n\nR252007-070718-Trooperslane.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Trooperslane\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_trooperslane_northern_ireland.txt','Heavy rail'

The derailed wagon was dragged onto the bridge, where it, and other wagons that subsequently derailed, caused considerable damage to the bridge structure. There were no casualties in the derailment.\n\nRAIB’s investigation identified the immediate cause of the incident was the right-hand leading wheel flange on wagon 16002 running over the rail head. This was caused by the leading right-hand suspension sticking (frictionally locking up), with the result that only the tip of the wheel flange was in contact with the rail. As the wagon rounded the curve only very small guiding forces acted on the flange, which were insufficient to keep the vehicle on the track.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made 16 recommendations, targeted at Network Rail, Lafarge Cement (the owners of the wagons), Wabtec Ltd (the maintainers of the wagons) and English, Welsh and Scottish Railway (now operating as D B Schenker), the operators of the train. These relate to the detection of out of balance wagons, standards and maintenance records for private owner wagons operating on Network Rail’s system, track maintenance standards and access times at Ely, and train preparation at Mountsorrel.\n\n \nR022009-090127-Ely.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Ely Dock Junction \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_ely.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 4 July 2009 a freight container train was travelling from Grangemouth, Scotland to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal when two container doors came open and struck three passenger trains on the West Coast Main Line between 16:02 hrs and 16:27 hours. There were no casualties as a result of the collision however the container doors and the passenger trains were damaged.\n\nThe container doors had come open without being identified. The evidence indicates that it is most likely that the doors came open as a result of criminal action.\n\nThe collisions with the passenger trains occurred because there was no feature on the container or wagon to prevent open container doors from going out of the allowable space envelope for loads carried on the railway.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations targeted at freight operating companies.

'\n  At 13:50 hrs on 4 December 2012, a train travelling from Scunthorpe to Lincoln struck and fatally injured a track worker at Saxilby, near Lincoln. The individual concerned was acting in the role of Controller of Site Safety (COSS) at the time of the accident. He was involved in work taking place on one of the two tracks at this location which was closed to rail traffic, but standing close to the adjacent line over which trains were still operating.\n\nThe RAIB’s investigation found that the COSS stepped back into the path of the train as it passed the site of work. The following factors led to the accident:\n\n\n  the COSS had not implemented a safe system of work for the task that was being undertaken at the time that the accident occurred\n  none of the other track workers on site challenged the absence of a safe system of work or the actions of the COSS who was working within an unsafe area\n  the COSS became distracted and did not see or hear the approaching train\n  no effective action had been taken in response to the involvement of the COSS in two other safety incidents in the two months preceding the accident\n  the COSS had not been subject to an effective formal performance review by the agency (SkyBlue) that had hired him for COSS duties for the work taking place on 4 December 2012 and on other occasions \n  deficiencies and omissions within SkyBlue’s management systems had not been identified by its parent company (Carillion).\n\n\nThe RAIB has also observed that the processes employed by the railway industry during its own investigation into the accident at Saxilby may have taken insufficient account of the trauma that some of the witnesses were suffering as a result of their proximity to the accident.\n\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail regarding the use of agency staff in safety leadership roles, measures to address the risk arising from the use of agency staff in any role that involves working on and around the track and its processes for interviewing witnesses after serious incidents and accidents.

'\n  On 26 April 2008 at approximately 06:30 hrs an engineers’ train involved in track renewal work struck the rear of a similar, stationary train at approximately 15 mph (22 km/h) whilst being positioned within the engineering possession for the work. Two wagons were severely damaged, and a locomotive sustained minor damage. There were no casualties.\n\nThe immediate cause of the collision was that the train driver did not limit his speed in accordance with the engineering supervisor’s instructions.\n\nThis was because:\n\n\n  The driver did not recognise he was within a work site, and did not control the speed of the train as instructed (and as laid down in the rule book)\n  There is no procedure to maintain a written record of an engineering supervisor’s instructions about the movement of trains in a work site. The lack of this discipline meant that the engineering supervisor did not realise that the driver had not absorbed his instructions\n  The driver was in a state of fatigue, which he did not report to his control\n  The engineering supervisor did not know the exact location of the trains within the work site, and hence his instructions to the driver were not specific\n  Other staff in the locomotive cab did not challenge the driver’s excessive speed.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made seven recommendations targeted at Network Rail, Balfour Beatty and the Rail Standards and Safety Board. These relate to the planning, risk assessment and use of engineering trains within work sites and the means of communication about the movement of such trains.\n\nR242009-090914-Leigh-on-Sea.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Leigh on Sea\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/freight_train_collision_at_leigh-on-sea.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 11:20 am on Sunday 27 July 2008, a luggage van sliding door on train 1S13, the 11:00 am King’s Cross to Aberdeen service, became detached and struck train 1A16, the 08:24 am Leeds to King’s Cross service.\n\nThis happened in the vicinity of New Southgate, around 6 ¾ miles (10.8 km) north of King’s Cross, at a closing speed of approximately 196 mph (314 km/h). Both trains were class 43 High Speed Trains (HSTs).\n\nThe side of train 1A16 suffered significant damage, although the passenger compartment was not penetrated. All doors and windows remained intact. A number of passengers and crew were shaken and one passenger reported suffering a minor eye injury as a result of glass-fibre particles entering a vestibule through a part open window.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the luggage van door was pulled off mountings by aerodynamic forces as the two trains passed, the door had been put into service with a faulty component and for other undetermined reasons was unlocked.\n\nThe investigation also established that there was no procedure in place to inform maintenance staff how to deal with a luggage van door that they could not repair.\n\nThe operator of both trains, National Express East Coast, did not appreciate the risk associated with HST luggage van doors, in part because the lessons of previous incidents were not incorporated into current processes. This situation arose as part of a general loss of awareness of the criticality of set-up and maintenance of luggage van doors within the industry.\n\nAs a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations addressed to National Express East Coast, and other operators and owners of trains with the type of door involved in the incident. These are relate to:\n\n\n  luggage van door set-up and maintenance\n  procedures for monitoring the frequency of luggage van doors being found open in traffic and the need to corrective action\n  procedures relating to what safety precautions should be put in place before a train can enter service with defective equipment.\n\n\nR172009-090624-NewSouthgate.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for New Southgate \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/minor_collision_near_new_southgate.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 17 July 2006 a shunter employed by Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd was crushed between a locomotive and a wagon during a shunting move at Dagenham Dock yard.

He had been standing or walking close to the train alongside a siding, and as the train passed he collapsed or tripped, and so fell into the gap between the buffers. If the shunter tripped, a causal factor was the damaged condition of the trackside walkway, which presented a hazard.

'\n  At around 23:55 hrs on 8 January 2011, a tamper driver walking to a tamper in a work site on the East Coast Main Line, was struck a glancing blow by a passenger train travelling at 100 mph (161 km/h). The tamper driver took evasive action when alerted by the train’s horn, and suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe investigation found that the tamper driver, who entered the railway in contravention of rules and his training, wrongly assumed that the line he was walking on was closed to normal traffic. The unsafe actions of the driver were found to have been a causal factor. However, the investigation also found that the driver did not have the information he needed to get to his tamper in safety.\n\nIndustry practices in which it was not uncommon for drivers to walk to trains in work sites without having first received a safety briefing were found to be an underlying cause of this accident. There were also deficiencies in the organisational arrangements for providing the tamper driver with information.\n\nRAIB has made a recommendation relating to the procedures followed by Network Rail and its contractors for providing train crews with safety briefings when accessing work sites.\n\nR022012-120215-Torworth.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Torworth\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/driver_injured_at_torworth_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 09:37 hrs on 2 December 2009, a westbound train struck and killed a track worker as it passed Whitehall West junction.  At the time of the accident the train was driven by a trainee in the presence of a supervisor driver while three more trainee drivers travelled in the rear vehicle. \n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the west-facing lookout did not move from the path of the train as it approached.\n\nThe causal factors were that the west-facing lookout: moved from a safe position and was possibly unaware that he was in the path of trains and was possibly unaware that a train was approaching him.\n\nRAIB also observed that: the Yorkshire Ambulance Service driver could not find the accident location without assistance as the access point had a grid reference but not a postcode and on another occasion this has the potential to cause delay; the work was planned to take place while the track remained open to trains; there were errors in the safe system of work; and the Huddersfield lines were re-opened in view of the accident site.\n\nRAIB made two recommendations concerning: consideration of ways to reduce the risk of lookouts moving dangerously close to trains and if appropriate making arrangements to physically identify a safe position; and the ambulance services of the United Kingdom should consider ways to reduce the risk of ambulance drivers being unable to find places on the railway that do not have postcodes and if appropriate make arrangements for them to navigate to those places.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, RAIB published the addendum to the report into the Fatal Accident at Whitehall West Junction, Leeds, on 2 December 2009. The addendum includes information on the briefing RAIB gave to the Operations Focus Group in September 2010, as the undertaking to do so in paragraph 82 of the report negated the need for a recommendation on the sounding of train horns.\n\nR152010-100902-Whitehall-West-Jn(addendum).pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Whitehall West Junction \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_whitehall_west_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  The RAIB investigation used data from a series of accidents and incidents which occurred at user worked level crossings between June 2006 and December 2008, and other information on crossing use, research programmes and current initiatives gathered by the RAIB from level crossing operators, train operators, and crossing users. The report looks at possible measures to reduce the risk at user worked level crossings.\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, the RAIB has made a submission to the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in connection with their current joint project to review the law relating to level crossings.

'\n  On 23 January 2013, train 1P18, the 10:00 hrs Greater Anglia service from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, derailed near London Liverpool Street.\n\nThe train comprised nine coaches pushed by a locomotive, and had just left platform 13. A total of 17 wheelsets derailed on a tight curve and, as the train proceeded, all the wheelsets were guided back onto the correct rail within a distance of 40 metres.\n\nThe driver was unaware of any problem until the senior conductor told him that passengers had reported a rough ride and the signaller advised him that the signalling system had identified a problem at a set of points used by the train when leaving Liverpool Street. The driver then stopped and examined his train at Shenfield, but saw nothing unusual. No one appreciated that there had been a derailment until the train was examined by a specialist inspector when it arrived at Norwich and, at about the same time, a signal maintenance team found track damage close to Liverpool Street station.\n\nThe train derailed on the curve because the track fixings had deteriorated over a period of time. This tight curve and other non-standard trackwork at Liverpool Street should have triggered consideration of mitigation measures to deal with the associated enhanced derailment risk. The investigation found that no consideration had been given to these enhanced risks because the maintenance management staff did not have the knowledge necessary to appreciate the need for, and to undertake, this activity. This lack of knowledge had not been appreciated by more senior staff. The Network Rail procedures for establishing a track inspection and maintenance regime for non-standard track did not require the regime to be independently checked.\n\nRAIB has identified six learning points and three recommendations. One learning point relates to effective communication between train and incident controllers when dealing with events which could be associated with urgent safety issues. A second learning point restates the relevance of Network Rail’s existing requirements for verifying maintenance management staff competencies relevant to risk assessing track assets. Three learning points refer to the need for a complete record of assets requiring maintenance, the importance of looking for signs of rail movement when inspecting track and the correct use of data obtained from a commonly used track geometry measurement device (an Amber trolley). The final learning point refers to the need for proper archiving of inspection records.\n\nThe three recommendations are all addressed to Network Rail. The first relates to providing assurance that suitable inspection regimes are established, recorded and validated for non-standard track assets. The second recommendation is intended to ensure assessment of management staff’s safety critical track related competencies to ensure they have the necessary experience and knowledge to perform that role. The third recommendation seeks a review and, if necessary, improvement of the competency assessment processes applicable to managers with safety critical roles linked to the maintenance of assets other than track.\n\nR272014_141211_Liverpool_Street.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Liverpool Street station, London\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_liverpool_street_station.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At around 11:35 hrs on 10 April 2015, a passenger was dragged along the platform at West Wickham station, south London, when the 11:00 hrs Southeastern service from London Cannon Street to Hayes (Kent) departed while her backpack strap was trapped in the doors of the train. As it moved off, she fell onto the platform and then through the gap between the platform and train, suffering life-changing injuries.\n\nThe backpack strap became trapped when the train doors closed unexpectedly and quickly while she was alighting. Testing showed that this potentially unsafe situation could only occur when a passenger pressed a door-open button, illuminated to show it was available for use, within a period of less than one second beginning shortly after the train driver initiated the door closure sequence.\n\nRAIB identified this door behaviour, which was not known to the owner or operator, and issued urgent safety advice. In response to this, the railway industry undertook a review which identified 21 other types of train that permit passenger doors to be opened for a short period after door closure is initiated by train crew. The industry is now seeking ways to deal with this risk.\n\nThe train was being driven by a trainee driver under the supervision of an instructor.  The service was driver only operation, which meant that before leaving West Wickham station, and after all train doors were closed, drivers were required to check that it was safe to depart by viewing CCTV monitors located on the platform.  Two of these monitor images showed that a passenger appeared to be trapped but, although visible from the driving cab, neither the trainee driver nor the instructor was aware of this.  Although the RAIB has not been able to establish why the trapped passenger was not seen before the train departed, a number of possible explanations have been identified.  \n\nAs a result of this accident, RAIB has made two recommendations. The first, addressed to operators and owners of trains with power operated doors, is intended to identify and correct all train door control systems exhibiting the unsafe characteristics found during this investigation. The second, addressed to RSSB, seeks changes to guidance documents so that, where practicable, staff dispatching trains watch the train doors while they are closing, in addition to checking the doors after they are closed.\n\nRAIB has also identified five learning points relating to: releasing train doors long enough to allow passengers to get on and off trains safely; effective checking of train doors before trains depart (and not relying on the door interlock light); design of door controls; and use of train driving simulators to raise drivers’ awareness of circumstances when it is not safe to depart from a station.\n\nR032016_160229_West_Wickham \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for West Wickham\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/serious_accident_at_west_wickham_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  \nAt approximately 10:13 hrs on Sunday 25 September 2011, the 10:10 hrs service from Kings Lynn to Ely operated by First Capital Connect struck a tractor on White House Farm User Worked Crossing (UWC).\n\nThe impact between the train and the tractor caused the front of the tractor to be separated from the driving cab. The tractor driver remained in the cab of the tractor, but suffered a broken collarbone, lacerations and bruising.\n\nThe tractor moved onto the crossing when the train was no more than 100 metres away and travelling at 70 mph (113 km/h). The train driver sounded the train’s horn and applied the emergency brake, but was unable to prevent the collision. The second wheelset on the train derailed after the collision occurred, but the train remained upright and in line while stopping. The train driver suffered a chest injury and shock in the accident. No-one else on the train was injured. Evacuation of passengers took place after three hours because equipment providing electrical power to trains had become dislodged and was hanging close to the track.\n\nAt the time of the accident, there were frequent movements of tractors and trailers over the crossing because of activity associated with the harvesting of sugar beet in an adjacent field. The tractor driver was telephoning the signaller at Kings Lynn to ask for permission to cross on each occasion. This was not the normal method of working; usually, crossing users would check that it was safe to cross before doing so and the signaller at Kings Lynn would not be aware that the crossing was being used.\n\nThe accident occurred because the signaller gave the tractor driver permission to cross before seeking confirmation that the train had passed. The tractor driver did not check for approaching trains because he considered that the signaller’s permission to cross was sufficient guarantee that it was safe to do so.\n\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch has made no recommendations. However, three learning points directly relevant to the causes or consequences of this accident have been identified:\n\n\n  signallers need to be made aware of the need to ensure that safety-critical messages are delivered in the right way;\n  when non-standard methods are to be applied for operating a UWC, it is important that all parties involved jointly review the proposed method of working, which should then be documented and confirmed in order that misunderstandings can be avoided; and\n  the availability of staff for earthing overhead line equipment at remote locations.\n\n\nThe RAIB has identified a further four learning points related to matters observed during its investigation, but not directly relevant to its cause or consequences. They cover:\n\n\n  the measurement of sighting distances as part of the assessment of safety at level crossings;\n  engagement between Network Rail and authorised users when assessing risk at UWCs so that the way in which the crossing is used can be considered as part of the exercise;\n  checks on telephones and the accuracy of signs at level crossings; and\n  keeping information on authorised users current.\n\n\n120329-R062012-White-House-Farm.pdf (950.89 kb) \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_between_a_train_and_tractor_at_white_house_farm_user_worked_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  A derailment occurred on the night of 3/4 May 2010 at Ashburys in Manchester. Five wagons loaded with aggregate ran away from a siding for 890 metres before two of them were derailed at trap points. The wagons had been left in the siding three days earlier.\n\nThe runaway was caused by ineffective handbrakes on the wagons. The investigation found deficiencies in the maintenance plan for the wagons and raised a concern about the way in which safety related information from other industries was brought to the attention of the rail industry.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations, relating to operating instructions, maintenance plans, distribution of safety related information from other industries and improved brake testing.\n\nR072011-110324-Ashburys.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Ashburys\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/runaway_and_derailment_at_ashburys.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  In the early hours of 28 December 2010, a passenger train was travelling from Manchester to Leeds when it struck a large amount of ice that had fallen onto the tracks from a ventilation shaft in Summit tunnel.  All wheels of the front bogie were derailed to the left in the direction of travel causing the front driving cab of the train to strike the tunnel wall.  The train remained upright and once it had stopped, the train crew took action to protect the train and raise the alarm.  About three hours later, the passengers and train crew had been led out of the tunnel by the emergency services.  No injuries were reported, while the train suffered damage to its cab windscreen, a coupler, bodywork and underframe.  There was minor damage to the track. \n\nThe ice formed as water, seeping through the lining of a ventilation shaft, froze during a long period of freezing temperatures.  This ice fell onto the track after a thaw which started on 27 December 2010.  The train, which was the first to pass through the tunnel in over three days due to the Christmas holiday period, then collided with it.  A combination of factors led to this accident:\n\n\n  the risk of ice, particularly ice falls onto the track, was not identified before the train service resumed so the train was allowed to enter Summit tunnel while running at its maximum permitted speed\n  the routine maintenance regime did not identify excessive ice in the tunnel and no additional inspections were carried out.\n\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations, all directed to Network Rail.  The first recommendation relates to how water in Summit tunnel is managed.  The second is about identifying those structures which are at risk from extreme weather and then checking they are safe to use after periods when no trains have been running.  The third calls for the potential hazards due to extreme weather and thaw conditions to be taken into account in Network Rail’s weather management processes.  The fourth calls for training and information to be given to staff who need to carry out the additional inspection of structures that are at risk in extreme cold weather.  The fifth relates to the management of safety related information (and details of actions taken) that is passed from Network Rail’s buildings and civils – asset management function to other parts of the company.\n\nR162011-110929-Summit-Tunnel.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Summit Tunnel \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_in_summit_tunnel.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At approximately 17:35 hrs on 17 August 2010, train 2T27, the 17:31 hrs service from Sudbury to Marks Tey, collided with a loaded 44 tonne articulated road tanker on Sewage Works Lane user worked crossing (UWC) near Sudbury in Suffolk. The collision caused the train to derail. Several passengers and the conductor on the train were injured in the collision; four passengers and the train driver were seriously injured.\n\nRAIB’s investigation found that the driver of the road tanker did not use the telephone provided before driving onto the crossing, although it was a requirement to do so.\n\nThe company employing the road tanker driver had not been briefed by Anglian Water (to whom they were contracted) on how their staff could use Sewage Works Lane UWC safely.\n\nThe investigation also found that the long waiting times that road vehicle drivers sometimes experienced before being given permission to use the crossing at Sewage Works Lane led to a high level of non-compliance with the correct procedures for its use. Network Rail’s processes relating to misuse at user worked crossings did not identify this issue and Network Rail’s procedures for responding to misuse and near-miss incidents on user worked crossings were unclear and sometimes not complied with. Network Rail’s data gathering exercises at Sewage Works Lane UWC (for the purposes of risk assessment) were characterised by errors and omissions and the amount of time devoted by Network Rail staff to analysing the results from the risk assessments and considering possible risk mitigation measures was limited. No single person or team in Network Rail had a complete understanding of the risk at Sewage Works Lane UWC.\n\nRAIB’s investigation has also found that the design of the tables in the type of train involved at Sewage Works Lane may have exacerbated the consequences of the accident and that the signage at Sewage Works Lane UWC presented information in an unclear manner.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations, covering the following areas:\n\n\n  improving safety at Sewage Works Lane UWC\n\n  reminders to business users at user worked crossings of their responsibility to brief contractors on how to use such crossings safely\n  Network Rail’s management of risk at crossings where there are long waiting times for road users\n  improvements in Network Rail’s processes for gathering information at user worked crossings\n  changes to Network Rail’s overall approach to the management of risk at level crossings\n  a review of the crashworthiness performance of the tables in the type of train involved in the accident.\n\n\nThe Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) has implemented research into signs at private railway crossings, thus obviating the need for the RAIB to make a recommendation to address this issue.\n\nR142011-110811-Sewage-Works-Lane.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Sewage Works Lane\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_sewage_works_lane_user_worked_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 16:13 hrs on 1 July 2008, a mobility scooter was driven onto Poplar Farm level crossing, Attleborough, Norfolk, into the path of the approaching train, the 15:52 hrs from Norwich to Liverpool Lime Street.\n\nThe train driver saw the mobility scooter but was unable to stop the train before it reached the crossing. However, the mobility scooter moved clear of the crossing before the train arrived, and there were no injuries or damage.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the crossing keeper mistakenly believed that an indicator showed ‘train in section’ for a train that had already passed over the level crossing, and did not appreciate that there was in fact a train approaching the level crossing from Attleborough station. In addition, vegetation alongside the line obstructed the visibility towards Attleborough.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made recommendations targeted at Network Rail. They relate to the need for it to review its procedures for the operation of Poplar Farm crossing, to identify improvements that would reduce the possibility of errors being made in the operation of the crossing.\n\nThe recommendations also propose that Network Rail should revise its current method of crossing inspections to take account of local factors relating to the method of operation of crossings; and changes in traffic levels.\n\nR142009-090611-PoplarFarm.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Poplar Farm\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near_miss_at_poplar_farm_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 27 December 2014, and again on 28 December 2014, track workers were at serious risk of being struck by trains at the Stockley Flyover construction site, on the Heathrow Airport branch line. In the second incident, a train did collide with a small trolley which was being placed on the line by track workers. \n\nDuring the first incident, 14 track workers walked along the open Down Airport line; an area where limited visibility meant that it was unsafe to do this when train services were operating. They mistakenly believed that train services had been stopped. A Heathrow Airport to London service used the line shortly after the workgroup had been warned by other staff and had moved clear. The investigation found that an inappropriate system was used to control access to the track, permitting trains to start operating when track workers could reasonably believe services remained suspended. Staff had also been directed to walk along a line when paperwork showed it was open to traffic.\n\nThe following day, two track workers were placing a small trolley on the Up Airport line when a train emerged from a nearby tunnel at a speed of 45 mph (72 km/h). The track workers moved clear of the line seconds before the train struck the trolley. There were no injuries and only minor damage. The track workers believed the line was closed, a consequence of being accustomed to working in a way which differed from the mandated site safety system. \n\nThe two incidents, and other safety shortcomings found, showed that site supervision processes had not identified that deviation from the mandated site safety system had become normal practice. Also, formalised briefings had not been supplemented by any site signage to increase the likelihood of staff being aware of which lines were open.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations, all addressed to Network Rail with some also seeking input from major contractors. The first seeks an improvement in monitoring of railway safety arrangements on major construction site. The second relates to effective monitoring of staff controlling access to worksites. The third seeks to provide workers on major construction sites with additional sources of information about the lines on which it is safe to work. The final recommendation seeks a review, and if necessary improvement, of the railway access control systems used on large construction sites.\n\nThree learning points are included to remind engineering supervisors and COSSs that they should comply with safety requirements and query any safety related anomalies in their paperwork. There are two other learning points made which are not directly related to the incidents: a reminder to employers that they should ensure that their staff have received railway rule book updates; and a reminder to those preparing site safety paperwork to make it comprehensive, but concise.\n\nR202015_151216_Heathrow_Tunnel_Junction\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Heathrow Tunnel Junction \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/unsafe_events_at_heathrow_tunnel_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 6:37am, 25 March 2008, a train of empty wagons derailed whilst travelling at 15mph (24 km/h) on a viaduct to the south of Birmingham (Moor St.) station. Of the four wagons that derailed, two overturned and one of these hit and demolished a 10 metre section of parapet wall. The wall fell approximately 20 metres onto private ground below, severely damaging an unoccupied, parked car.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the wheel of one of the wagons rode over the rail at the location of a severe track twist. Causal factors were that the track geometry was not compliant with industry standards, and that the track twist had not been detected or corrected. The underlying factor was that Network Rail did not identify the contribution that voids under the sleepers were making to the derailment risk in this area, and did not implement measures to control the risk.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations as a result of this accident. These concern the design and maintenance of the track near Moor Street station, and methods to improve the identification of voids under sleepers.\n\nOne further recommendation is targeted at DB Schenker Rail (UK) Ltd, the train operator, which was trading as English, Welsh & Scottish Railway Ltd at the time of the accident. This relates to ensuring that wagons are maintained at the intervals specified in company procedures.\n\nR072009-090318-Moor-Street.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Moor Street\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_near_moor_street_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Monday 21 November 2005 a train travelling towards Nottingham observed a person on Barratt’s Lane No.1 footpath crossing, shortly before Attenborough station. The driver sounded the train horn and braked, but struck the pedestrian on the crossing and fatally injured him. The pedestrian was knocked onto the opposite line where a second train, despite being given a visual warning to stop by the first train, was unable to stop short of the accident site and therefore passed over the body.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the pedestrian being struck by a train while using the footpath crossing in foggy conditions.

'\n  On 28 January at about 14:15 hrs, a fault in a stabled engineering wagon’s brake system caused it to run away and collide with a road-rail vehicle (RRV), which was being used for track renewal work. The RRV operator was shaken but uninjured and there was little damage to either vehicle.\n\nThe immediate cause was the wagon being left unsecured on the slope, leading to its brake system leaking off, and the collision. A causal factor was the unauthorised coupling and uncoupling of vehicles by staff without proper training. A contributory factor was that a train driver did not apply the handbrakes on the wagon.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations as a result of this incident. These involve the procedures to couple and uncouple vehicles on track work sites.

'\n  At 05:28 hrs on 12 June 2011, train 1U11, a passenger service running from Gatwick Airport to London Victoria, travelling at about 60 mph (96 km/h), struck a member of railway staff at Stoats Nest Junction on the main line between London and Brighton, about one mile (1.6 km) south of Purley station. The person who was struck was one of a team of ten people carrying out maintenance work on the track, and he was seriously injured. There was no damage to the train or infrastructure.\n\nThe track worker who was struck did not move to a position of safety and remained in the path of the train as it passed the site of the work. Although one of the lines at the site had been returned to use shortly before the accident, having been closed as part of a possession, work continued in the vicinity of that line, and no measures were put in place to protect personnel from the passage of trains on that line.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail relating to the implementation of processes intended to deter managers from undermining the safety related duties of other staff.\n\nR162012-120806-Stoats-nest.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Stoats Nest\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/track_worker_struck_at_stoats_nest_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 21 October 2008 the 08:33 hrs train from Birmingham to Aberystwyth ran over Llanbadarn automatic half barrier level crossing, near Aberystwyth, whilst the barriers were raised, narrowly missing a road tanker carrying liquefied petroleum gas.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver of the train did not brake his train sufficiently early to stop before the crossing when the driver’s indicator at the crossing (the DCI) was showing a flashing red aspect.\n\nThe investigation concluded that driver did not apply his brakes until 9.7 seconds after passing the special speed restriction board for the crossing, anticipating that the driver’s crossing indicator would change from a flashing red aspect to a flashing white aspect. It also concluded that the driver may have been fatigued, or distracted by the presence of two other drivers in the cab with him.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the settings of the driver’s crossing indicators on other similar crossings on the Cambrian lines of Network Rail may have conditioned the driver to expect flashing red aspects to continue after passing the special speed restriction board, and that the railway industry Rule Book does not give explicit guidance as to what to do with regard to the speed of a train if the driver’s crossing indicator displays a flashing red aspect when the driver passes the special speed restriction board.\n\nAlthough not a direct factor, as a flashing red aspect is a normal condition, the breakdown of an unorthodox method of carrying out maintenance of the crossing resulted in the flashing red aspect being displayed to the driver, and the crossing not operating.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made eight recommendations, targeted at Network Rail, Arriva Trains Wales Ltd (the operator of the train involved) and the Rail Safety and Standards Board.\n\nThese concern the design of Llanbadarn level crossing, modifications to other crossings that display aspects similar to that which may have affected the driver’s actions, Rule Book amendments and briefings to drivers and the maintenance procedures for automatic level crossings on the Cambrian lines.\n\nR202009-090728-Llanbadarn.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Llanbadarn\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near_miss_at_llanbadarn_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 2 August 2007 at approximately 15:22 hrs, train B413, the Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) service from Londonderry was 700 metres away from the disused station at Limavady Junction when it collided with a tractor on crossing XL202. The tractor driver died as a result of his injuries.\n\nThe train was travelling at approximately 33 mph and the driver sounded the horn continuously as he approached the crossing. The train driver suffered shock and was taken to hospital. None of the 65 passengers or the conductor were injured; the train was damaged but did not derail. Rail services re-commenced early the next day.\n\nThe investigation identified that the tractor driver may have lost concentration as he approached the crossing. It suggests the position of the sun, the design of the crossing and the tractor’s roof support pillar may have affected the tractor driver’s view of the approaching train. NIR has now redesigned the crossing.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations relating to:\n\n\n  level crossing signage\n  management of risk at user worked crossings, and specifically crossing XL202\n  improving the design of the evacuation ladders carried on NIR rolling stock.\n\n\nR102008-080424-XL202.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Limavady\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_near_limavady_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 10 June 2006 an exterior door on a train from St Pancras to Sheffield came open while the train was moving. The door came open on the class 222 Meridian just north of Kettering, causing the train’s brake to apply automatically. However, the driver initially overrode this as indications in his cab were ambiguous, and he was uncertain what had happened. When the driver realised the situation, he made a controlled brake and brought the train to a stand at Desborough summit, six miles north of Kettering station. The door was then closed and secured, and the train continued to the next station, where it was taken out of service.\n\nThere were no injuries or material damage as a result of the incident. However, the state of the door after the train departed from Luton station presented a real and unprotected risk to those on board the train.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was a malfunction of the door lock switch, which detects the status of the door lock, when the doors were opened at Luton station. This meant the door was both unlocked and had no closing force applied to it from the door motor. There were also nine contributory factors to the incident.\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\n\n\n  the design, development and manufacturing of door components and the door locking system\n  training and procedures for on-board staff\n  the design of and guidance for the use of emergency brakes.\n\n\n \nR312007-070830-Desborough.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Desborough\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/train_door_incident_near_desborough.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 07:19 hrs on 26 October 2014, train 2K00, the 06:42 hrs Milton Keynes Central to Euston passenger service struck an open door of a lineside equipment cabinet while travelling through Watford Tunnel. The cabinet door detached from its hinges, hitting the side of the train and damaging a door on one of the carriages. The damage to the train door caused a safety circuit to detect that the door was no longer properly closed and the train’s brakes were applied automatically. On examining his train, the driver found that a door on the fourth carriage had been severely damaged. Passengers in this carriage also reported they had been showered by flying glass from the damaged door, although none reported any injuries.\n\nRAIB’s investigation found that the cabinet door had opened under aerodynamic forces as the train passed, probably because the door had been left closed, but unsecured, during work that had been taking place on equipment in the cabinet overnight. A number of reasons that may explain why the door had been left unsecured were identified, including poor task lighting, the methods that had been employed during the work overnight, no-one being allocated the responsibility for checking that cabinet doors were closed and secured and the possibility that the staff involved may have been suffering from fatigue, making it more likely that a mistake would be made. An associated underlying factor was that Siemens, the employer of the staff involved, had not fully implemented its policy on fatigue management.\n\nThe cabinet involved had been installed recently as part of a re-signalling project for the Watford area. It was equipped with two doors with side hinges and had been positioned such that an open door could be struck by a train. An underlying factor was that the risk of this happening had not been identified when this design of cabinet was selected for use in Watford Tunnel. Previous risk assessments undertaken during the period when the cabinet was originally subject to product acceptance were not available to the project team or Henry Williams Ltd, the manufacturer of the cabinet involved.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations. Four recommendations have been made to Network Rail, covering processes for handing back sections of railway after engineering work, its policy on locating lineside equipment in areas of restricted clearance, the design of lineside equipment for areas of restricted clearance and improvements to its product acceptance processes so that previously undertaken risk assessments are available to future users of individual items of equipment. One recommendation has been made to Siemens UK Ltd in respect of the implementation of its policies on staff welfare (including fatigue management), and one recommendation has been made to Henry Williams Ltd in conjunction with Network Rail to make sure that it has full details of the certification of its products used on the railways.\n\nRAIB has also identified two learning points. The first relates to the adequacy of task lighting and the need for staff on site to reach a clear understanding about who will be responsible for closing cabinet doors. The second is a reminder of the need for staff involved in projects to implement existing processes for risk assessment and product acceptance.\n\nR122015_150813_Watford_Tunnel\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Watford Tunnel\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/train_struck_and_damaged_in_watford_tunnel.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 15:25 hrs on 23 October 2014, a freight train derailed just after passing through Heworth station on the railway line from Sunderland to Newcastle. It was travelling at 51 mph (82 km/h) when the leading wheelset of the tenth wagon in the train derailed on track with regularly spaced dips in both rails, a phenomenon known as cyclic top. The train continued for about 1.4 miles (2.3 km) where it was stopped by the signaller, who had become aware of a possible problem with the train from damage to the signalling system. By the time the train stopped, all of the wagon’s wheels were derailed and its suspension was damaged.  \n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was a combination of a loss of damping within the suspension on one corner of the wagon that made it susceptible to derailing on the cyclic top track defect it passed over. This was because:\n\n\n  The wagon had a worn suspension component that made its leading left-hand wheel susceptible to unloading and lifting up when responding to dips in the track. The wagon’s maintenance regime had not identified this worn component. The excessive wear was most likely due to misalignment of the wheelset within its suspension.\n  The severity of the dips in the track required Network Rail to impose an emergency speed restriction but no such restriction had been put in place.  \n  The cyclic top defect formed due to water in the track not draining away and although the track inspection regime had identified this defect many times, often no repair took place. Occasionally the local Network Rail track maintenance team carried out manual repairs but these were ineffective.\n  The local Network Rail track maintenance team was unable to cope with the volume of work it had to do. This was due to insufficient numbers of track maintenance staff over a long period of time, changes to the arrangements for working safely while on the track, restrictions on gaining access to the track and changes to how the track was inspected. Network Rail’s management arrangements did not identify the extent of non-compliances to its maintenance processes, or take earlier action to resolve the persistent problems that were affecting track maintenance in this area.\n\n\nSince the derailment, the wagon owner and operator, Freightliner, has carried out additional checks to identify any other wagons with the same worn suspension component and modified the maintenance regime for these wagons.  Network Rail has instructed its staff to always impose an emergency speed restriction for cyclic top defects, which shall remain in place until monitoring has shown that its staff have made an effective repair.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations.  One is directed to Freightliner and covers mitigating the risk of the ride performance on this type of wagon being degraded by worn suspension components. The other four are directed to Network Rail and cover:\n\n\n  investigating why water is not draining from the track where the train derailed\n  reviewing whether defects found by the track inspection regime are being accurately recorded and that corresponding repair work is planned\n  understanding and taking action to address why the track assets in this area consistently have high numbers of defects\n  understanding and taking action to address why Network Rail’s management arrangements allowed the serious non-compliances with track maintenance processes found by this investigation to go undetected over a long period of time.\n\n\nR162015_150924_Heworth\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Heworth\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_heworth.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  The first incident occurred at around 02:24 hrs, when two empty containers were blown off freight train 4E90, while it was travelling on the down fast line of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Cheddington, near Leighton Buzzard. The train consisted of a Class 56 locomotive hauling 20 FEA-B type flat wagons and was running at approximately 75 mph (121 km/h). The detached containers blocked the running lines and caused damage to overhead line equipment (OLE) and the track.\n\nThe second incident occurred at around 03:15 hrs on the same day when five empty containers were blown from freight train 4S83, while it was travelling on the down line of the WCML adjacent to Hardendale Quarry, between Tebay and Penrith. This train consisted of two Class 86 locomotives hauling 20 container flat wagons of mixed types, including 10 FEA-B wagons, and was also running at approximately 75 mph (121 km/h). The detached containers were blown from the rearmost four FEA-B wagons of the train. They blocked running lines and caused damage to the OLE and track.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incidents was the overturning and detachment of the empty freight containers, due to the aerodynamic forces resulting from a combination of high cross winds and train speeds. There were several causal and contributory factors and two underlying factors. The causal factors were:\n\n\n  the high cross wind speeds at both sites\n  both trains were travelling at close to their permitted maximum speed of 75 mph (121 km/h)\n  the containers which detached were empty\n  the lack of overturning retention provided by the FEA-B wagon’s fold-down spigots, because the spigots had not been designed in accordance with the appropriate standard\n  the wagon manufacturer had not appreciated the function and operating principles of the spigots\n  the lack of explicit warning in the design standard covering spigots, about the use of inboard hinges for fold-down spigots\n  the lack of checks on the spigots by the vehicle acceptance body during the vehicle approvals process\n  the lack of a mandatory UK design Railway Group Standard (RGS) relating to load retention devices\n  the lack of use of guidance documentation during the vehicle approvals process\n  the freight operators not identifying that the FEA-B wagon’s fold-down spigots could not secure containers from overturning.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made ten recommendations, targeted as follows:\n\n\n  Freight operators: five recommendations relating to operating wagons fitted with UIC spigots in windy conditions, checking compliance of spigots on existing wagons, reviewing maintenance documentation and developing a long term solution for wagons fitted with non-compliant spigots\n  The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR): one recommendation relating to clarification of the European freight wagon standard, so that in future designers are made aware of the operating principles of spigots and the dangers of fold-down spigots\n  Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB): three recommendations relating to UK standards for load retention devices and minimum container weights and a review of the implementation of the vehicle certification process\n  Network Rail: one recommendation to review the compatibility of the wind speeds and durations at which actions are taken to protect the network with the design requirements for trains in relation to overturning.\n\n\nR122009-0905027-Containers.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Cheddington and Hardendale \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/detachment_of_containers_from_freight_wagons.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 21:40 hrs on 26 July 2015, a passenger train derailed after striking eight cows that had gained access to the railway at Godmersham in Kent, between Wye and Chilham stations. There had been a report of a cow on the railway an hour earlier, but a subsequent examination by the driver of the next passing train did not find anything. There were no further reports from other trains that passed before the accident occurred. \n\nThe train involved in the accident was travelling at 69 mph (111 km/h) at the point of impact. There were 67 passengers on board plus three members of staff; no injuries were reported at the time of the accident. Because the train’s radio had ceased to work during the accident, the driver ran for about three-quarters of a mile towards an oncoming train, which had already been stopped by the signaller, and used its radio to report the accident.\n\nThe accident occurred because the fence had not been maintained so as to restrain cows from breaching it, and because the railway’s response to the earlier report of a cow on the railway side of the fence was insufficient to prevent the accident. In addition, the absence of an obstacle deflector on the leading unit of the train made the derailment more likely.\n\nAs a result of this accident, RAIB has made five recommendations addressing the fence inspection process, clarification of railway rules in response to reports of large animals within the boundary fence, the fitting of obstacle deflectors to rolling stock (two recommendations), and the reliability of the train radio equipment.\n\nRAIB has also identified two learning points for the railway industry, relating to the railway’s response to emergency situations, including the response to reports of large animals within the boundary fence and the actions to take following an accident.\n\nR052016_160406_Godmersham \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Godmersham\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_godmersham_kent.txt','Heavy rail'

No one was hurt but the track, the embankment and some of the wagons were damaged.\n\nThe investigation found the embankment failed under the weight of the passing train because water within the embankment had reduced its stability and none of Network Rail’s processes had identified this. It is possible that an evaluation of the embankment could have identified the reduced stability, but the circumstances for triggering an evaluation were unclear, and there was no defined process for reporting trigger events. The investigation also observed that the evaluation process did not make use of rainfall data, or data that showed how the geometry of the track on top of the embankment was changing over time. An additional inspection during flooding could possibly have identified the embankment’s reduced stability. However, none was required at this location as Network Rail did not consider how the embankment was constructed when assessing the risk of an earthwork failure due to water. It is also possible that the embankment’s reduced stability could have been identified by a routine examination, but none was due. A basic visual track inspection had been planned for three days before the accident but it was not completed. It is possible that this planned inspection would have found a track defect which could have led to the discovery of the embankment’s reduced stability.\n\nThe report makes three recommendations, all to Network Rail, which cover:\n\n\n  the provision of information to trigger an earthwork evaluation\n  using track geometry and rainfall data to improve the earthwork evaluation process\n  improving the process used to decide if an earthwork should be inspected when a flood warning is issued.  \n\n\nR222013-131211-Barrow-Upon-Soar.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Barrow upon Soar\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_barrow_upon_soar.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 27 August 2013, at around 04:27 hrs, a freight train derailed by two axles as it traversed Stoke Lane level crossing on the Newark to Nottingham line.The train was travelling at a speed of 53 mph (85 km/h) when the trailing wheelsets of the 26th and 28th wagons derailed. Consequential damage to the rear of the train resulted in an air leak and the automatic application of the brakes. The train came to a stop after around 1.3 km, at Carlton station. The wagons remained upright and in line, and did not foul the adjacent running line. There was no leakage of diesel fuel from any of the tank wagons. The track was damaged by the derailed wheelsets for a distance of around 800 metres. The driver was not injured. The railway remained closed for repairs until 15:30 hrs on 8 September 2013.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was a severe dip in the track which developed rapidly under the leading portion of the train. After the derailment, severe dips of about 100 mm were found in both rails of the affected line, where the rails had deformed over a large void in the ground which had left the track unsupported over a length of around 3 metres. The void under the railway and other voids found later under the adjacent road surface were caused by excessive ground loss during the recent construction of a microtunnel along the road centre line. RAIB’s investigation has interpreted the available evidence in order to identify the most likely cause of the voids. Although some alternative explanations cannot be completely discounted, RAIB considers that the most likely explanation for the ground loss is that it was as a result of overmining of the ground during the construction work.\n\nRAIB’s investigation identified safety lessons, both for those in the construction industry who build undertrack crossings and also for the railway regarding managing asset protection processes for such constructions. In line with the RAIB’s remit, the improvement of railway asset protection processes to prevent recurrence has been the focus of its investigation. This is reflected in the balance of the recommendations made, which relate to the following areas:\n\n\n  disseminating key learning points arising from this accident to the UK tunnelling industry, via the Health and Safety Executive and relevant industry bodies \n  improving Network Rail’s asset protection standard for construction of under track crossings so that there is one unified standard applicable to both outside parties and Network Rail\n  improving the technical knowledge of Network Rail’s asset protection engineers about under track crossings and increasing the time and technical assistance available to them to adequately assess risks and review documentation submitted by outside parties\n  reviewing the suitability of the action limits in Network Rail’s standard for monitoring track movement over or adjacent to civil engineering works, including under track crossings.\n\n\nR022015_150402_Stoke_Lane \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Stoke Lane \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_stoke_lane_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At around 23:58 hrs on 16 January 2014, a passenger train travelling between Crewe and Shrewsbury struck a welder’s trolley that had been placed on the line at Bridgeway user worked crossing. The train was travelling at about 85 mph (137 km/h) at the point of collision and stopped in just under 0.5 miles (0.8 km). A track worker, who was on the trolley loading it with tools, jumped clear when he became aware of the approaching train a few seconds before impact. He suffered minor injuries. The train sustained significant damage to its front and to underframe equipment, including the fuel tank, and the trolley was destroyed. Neither the train driver, conductor, nor the one passenger on board the train were injured. The group of three staff involved (Controller of Site Safety (COSS), welder and track worker) were taken back to Shrewsbury depot some four hours after the accident.\n\nThe accident occurred because the trolley was placed on a line that had not been blocked to normal train operations. The Controller of Site Safety (COSS) had blocked the opposite line on the advice of the welder, who had been misled by the presentation of information in the paperwork describing the safety arrangements for the job. However, the welder later realised that the work was actually on the line that had not been blocked, but he still placed his trolley on that line believing that no train would approach because of engineering work taking place elsewhere in the area. The COSS was not directly supervising the workers when the trolley was placed on the line. Prior decisions made in work planning and resourcing, and the absence of relevant information in the paperwork about the location of the work, contributed to poor decision-making by the track workers on the night of the accident. In investigating this accident, the RAIB also observed that there were a number of deficiencies in competence management at Shrewsbury Maintenance Delivery Unit, and that welfare arrangements for the track workers in the immediate aftermath of the accident were poor.\n\nRAIB has identified three learning points and made three recommendations, all to Network Rail. The learning points relate to competence management practices and briefings at Shrewsbury Maintenance Delivery Unit, and the importance of staff relying on their own safe systems of work rather than making assumptions about work taking place elsewhere. The recommendations focus on the presentation of information in the paperwork describing the safety arrangements for the job, factors affecting planning decisions at Shrewsbury Maintenance Delivery Unit, and Network Rail’s competence management processes for staff on secondments or returning to work from a period of absence.\n\nR252014-141120-Bridgeway.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nResponse to recommendations for Bridgeway user worked crossing\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_with_trolley_at_bridgeway_user_worked_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 23:29 hrs on 22 October 2011, a young person was struck and killed by the train she had left 30 seconds earlier. She was leaning against the train as it began to move out of the station and when she fell, the platform edge gap was wide enough for her to fall through and onto the track. Her post-mortem toxicology report recorded a blood alcohol concentration nearly three times the UK legal drink drive limit.\n\nThe guard dispatched the train while the young person was leaning against it. The RAIB concluded it is possible that he did this because he had seen her but expected her to move away before the train moved or that he looked briefly in her direction but did not see her or that he did not see her because his attention was on his control panel and a large group of people on the platform.\n\nPlatform video camera footage shows him warning her to stand back in the moments before the train departs and it is likely he did this because he thought that it would be immediately effective and because he had no direct and immediate way to stop the train.\n\nWhile the rail industry’s overall safety record has improved in recent years, accidents at the platform/train interface have increased, even when accounting for an increased number of passenger journeys over a period of time which saw a known industry hazard (trains with slam doors but no central locking) withdrawn from service. This indicates that the industry’s focus on operational matters has not delivered improved safety at the platform/train interface, and there is a need to consider technical as well as operational solutions to reduce the risk.\n\nThis report makes three recommendations: one is for Merseyrail to evaluate and where practical improve the means of train dispatch. The second is for Merseyrail, in consultation with other relevant organisations, to evaluate equipment and methods to reduce the likelihood of persons falling through the platform edge gap and to implement these measures when practical. The third is for the Office of Rail Regulation to ensure that there is industry guidance on reducing the risk at the platform/train interface; in particular the guidance should consider both equipment and methods of operation.\n\nR222012-121127-James-Street.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for James Street\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_james_street_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 09:55 hrs on Wednesday 29 August 2007 a track patrolman, a Network Rail (NR) employee, who was carrying out routine track inspection work, was struck by a passenger train, operated by South West Trains, at Leatherhead junction, about 50m south of Leatherhead station, Surrey. The patrolman was seriously injured, and has not yet been able to return to work.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause was that the patrolman had remained in the space between two railway lines as the train approached him. He had been warned of the approach of the train, and responded to that warning, but did not move to a safe place before the train arrived. A causal factor was that Network Rail had not prohibited work on the track at this location while trains were running, despite the limited visibility of approaching trains caused by the sharp curves nearby.\n\nContributory factors included:\n\n\n  the working practices of the gang of track workers\n  the person in charge of the gang not confirming that the patrolman was clear of the track\n  that person not having been given adequate guidance on making arrangements for protecting workers on the track\n  this deficiency not being identified by Network Rail management.\n\n\nThe underlying cause was that inspection work was taking place on the track while trains were running.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made six recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail. Four of these recommendations address wide-ranging issues related to track worker safety and the quality of track inspections. The fifth and sixth recommendations propose that Network Rail revises its track inspection processes in order to improve staff safety.\n\nR192008-081023-Leatherhead.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for  Leatherhead\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_leatherhead.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 06:50 hrs on 25 March 2012, a machine operator was in the process of removing a road-rail dumper from the railway close to Bradford Interchange station. As it was being lowered onto its road wheels, it ran away for 380 metres down a gradient towards the station.\n\nThe operator, who was on the dumper, was unable to stop it and jumped clear before it collided with the buffer stops in platform 1. The operator received minor injuries, and the dumper and buffer stop sustained some damage.\n\nThe RAIB’s investigation identified that the dumper was not in a fully braked state when being removed from the track. This was due to a combination of operator error, a wiring irregularity within a control circuit, and the underlying design of the same control circuit which prevented the operator from recovering the situation once the runaway had begun.\n\nThe RAIB has made five recommendations. Two recommendations have been made to Quattro Plant Limited, the owner and maintainer of the dumper. It was also responsible for the design and installation of the braking control circuit and provided the machine operator. One of these recommendations relates to improving the level of safety assurance when undertaking modifications to road-rail vehicles (RRVs). The other relates to better management of the competence of its staff.\n\nThree recommendations have been made to Network Rail. One is in relation to minimising the risk of runaways on certain types of RRVs on which the design restricts the ability to regain control of an RRV once it has begun to runaway. Another relates to reviewing and improving compliance monitoring and assurance activities, which both Network Rail and its rail plant suppliers undertake, in order to provide better focus on matters relating to the safe maintenance and operation of RRVs. The third recommendation is to review two aspects of the engineering acceptance process, to give clarity to rail plant suppliers and those assessing modifications to RRVs.\n\nThe RAIB has also identified a learning point for RRV owners regarding possible improvements to the layout of RRV controls to minimise unintentional operation.\n\nR092013-130724-Bradford- Interchange.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bradford Interchange \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_bradford_interchange_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Thursday 09 February an EWS freight train passed a signal at danger and derailed at a set of trap points at the end of a goods line at Brentingby Junction, near Melton Mowbray. The locomotive and the first three wagons were derailed. There were no injuries as a result of the accident, but some damage was caused to the wagons.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the driver had a microsleep approaching the signal, and was only woken after the train had derailed beyond the signal. Two causal factors were that the driver was suffering from fatigue and the use of trap points as a measure to mitigate overruns. There were several contributory factors to the incident, including that the driver had intended to stop at the signal, rather than 20m short as required. He did this to avoid walking to the signal post telephone.\n\nRAIB has made ten recommendations as a result of its investigation. They cover:\n\n\n  improvements to the management of fatigue;\n  improving the safety of trap points; and\n  re-positioning the signal post telephone.\n\n\nR012007-070123-Brentingby.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Brentingby Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_brentingby_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 16:32 hrs on 2 May 2012, a cyclist who was using the footpath and bridleway level crossing at Kings Mill, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, was struck and fatally injured by a passenger train travelling at about 56 miles per hour (90 kilometres per hour).\n\nThe cyclist rode over the crossing into the path of the train. He was unaware of the train’s approach, probably because he had not looked towards it after passing through the gate protecting the crossing and he was wearing earphones, which probably prevented him from hearing warnings sounded by the train’s horn.\n\nThe RAIB has made one recommendation, which is not related to the causes of the accident, but arises from matters relating to the management and history of the crossing that were observed during the investigation. Addressed to the Health & Safety Executive and the Office of Rail Regulation, it is intended to improve the awareness of local authorities (who may promote or approve developments which affect the usage of level crossings) in relation to the hazards which exist at level crossings.\n\nThere is also a key learning point for Network Rail and other crossing operators, relating to the importance of considering all possible measures to reduce risk at crossings, not just those that involve major changes.\n\nR012013-130114-Kings-Mill.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Kings Mill No 1 level crossing, Mansfield\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_kings_mill_no_1_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 12 June 2008, a wheelset on an FTA/FSA type wagon derailed as it passed through Marks Tey junction, located on Network Rail’s Great Eastern Mainline.  A second wheelset on the same bogie subsequently also derailed.  Two members of staff received minor injuries as a result of the derailment, which also caused damage to the infrastructure and rolling stock involved.  The line was re-opened fully the following morning. \n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the left-hand wheel of the trailing wheelset of the rear bogie of the derailed wagon running over the cess rail head and derailing as the train traversed a section of plain line between a set of trailing points and a set of facing points at Marks Tey junction. \n\nThe causal factors were the unloading of the wheels of the rear axle of the trailing bogie of the derailed wagon; a dip in vertical alignment of the track caused by the incorrect replacement of the bearers at the heel of the points; the presence of cyclic top shortly after these points; and the permitted speed of the train.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations relating to the following areas: reducing the risk of derailment of FSA and FTA wagons; the competence, management of track recording, and access to the line for Network Rail’s Colchester Maintenance delivery unit; the planning and briefing of preventative maintenance tasks; and the management of broken rails and timber bearer replacements.\n\nR012010-100114-MarksTey.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Marks Tey\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_of_a_freight_train_at_marks_tey.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  An engineering possession was established on the night of 27/28 October 2012 between Stirling and Blackford in Scotland. A possession is an arrangement whereby the line is closed to normal traffic to allow engineering staff to carry out work. Several items of maintenance work were planned to be carried out in this possession and these items were grouped into four work sites. At 07:04 hrs the person in charge of the possession authorised the reopening of the line to normal traffic when only three of the work sites had completed their work and were clear of the line. Work in the fourth work site was still ongoing when the line reopened to traffic.\n\nSeven members of staff were working on the line along with a road-rail excavator and trailer. This work continued for an hour after the line was reopened. No collision occurred as there were no trains scheduled at the time, but there were no measures in place to prevent a train from being signalled through the work site.\n\nThe person in charge of the possession did not record details of the work site on the possession form. He was under some stress from events outside of his work at the time and this may have affected his performance. Other probable factors were late alterations to the work sites within the possession and the way in which the briefing pack for the possession was presented.\n\nThe RAIB has identified three learning points related to the use of the possession arrangements form, the way in which possession information packs are prepared and dealing with staff under stress.\n\nR052013-130425-Dunblane.pdf \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/dangerous_occurrence_near_dunblane.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At around 18:26 hrs on 26 May 2011, a First Capital Connect service from Brighton to Bedford lost traction power and became stranded between St. Pancras and Kentish Town stations. Almost three hours elapsed before the train, with its passengers still on board, was assisted into Kentish Town station.\n\nDuring the period that the train was stranded, conditions for passengers became increasingly uncomfortable because the train was heavily loaded and the air-conditioning and toilets stopped working at an early stage. Some passengers opened doors to improve ventilation and passenger alarms were repeatedly activated.\n\nThe strategy for rescuing the stranded train was to bring another train onto the front and haul it into Kentish Town station. The arrival of the assisting train was delayed and it did not couple onto the front of the failed train until around 20:20 hrs. During the next 50 minutes, the driver of the combined train tried to complete the arrangements necessary for its movement into Kentish Town. He was hampered by further operation of alarms by passengers frustrated at the continuing delay, and his uncertainty over the status of the doors (open or closed) on part of the train. A small number of passengers started to alight from the train.\n\nEventually, the driver over-rode a safety system in order to move the train. At the time when the train moved a short distance for the driver to test that it was properly coupled, some passengers were still alighting from the train to the track. When the train subsequently moved into Kentish Town, it did so with at least two doors open.\n\nThe investigation found that options for evacuating passengers, other than the use of an assisting train, had either been discounted or had not been briefed to those staff responsible for developing the rescue strategy on the day. There had been very little communication with passengers during the incident because the public address system on the train failed about 45 minutes after the train became stranded. Previous incidents of a similar nature had been investigated by First Capital Connect, but actions had not been taken on the findings.\n\nRAIB has made:\n\n\n  one recommendation to First Capital Connect in relation to its management processes for emergency preparedness\n  one recommendation to Network Rail and the train operators on developing a set of principles for dealing with stranded trains\n  one recommendation to Network Rail and the train operators to review their processes for undertaking incident reviews so that safety lessons are captured, tracked to closure and shared with other industry stakeholders.\n\n\nR072012-120523-Kentish-Town.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Kentish Town \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/incident_between_dock_junction_and_kentish_town.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 10 May 2007 at 06.40, an EWS empty coal train derailed on its approach to Newcastle station and caused significant damage to operating equipment on the track and King Edward Bridge; in addition several wagons were severely damaged. There were no injuries but train services were disrupted and some tracks were closed for several days.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was a combination of a relatively minor track defect and a distorted wagon frame. Causal factors involved the wagon experiencing a twist as it passed over a set of points. There were also five contributory factors.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of this incident.

'\n  At about 17:52 hrs on 27 July 2011, an empty passenger train derailed while traversing points in the Princes Street Gardens area, on its approach to Edinburgh Waverley station. The leading bogie of the third coach of the three-coach train derailed and travelled derailed for approximately 110 metres. The derailment occurred at slow speed and the train remained upright. The driver and conductor, the only occupants of the train, were uninjured. The derailment affected two lines which were closed until 29 July 2011.\n\nThe investigation found that the first wheel to derail was not correctly steered by the moveable switch rail to the correct route. Instead the wheel climbed over the rail, pulling the other wheels of the bogie into derailment.\n\nThe most likely cause of the derailment was that the angle of the switch rail, possibly aided by an increase in friction, enabled the wheel to climb the switch rail.\n\nThree days prior to the accident the left-hand switch rail had been identified as having the potential to cause derailment. Although it was worn beyond repair by grinding in accordance with the company standard, a grinding repair was attempted. The subsequent inspection process did not find the switch to be unsafe and it remained in service.\n\nThe required prior scoping of the repair, which might have identified the unsuitability of the switch rail for repair by grinding, was not carried out.\n\nThe local practice of maintaining points to safety limits and the lack of guidance on when a switch rail is unrepairable by grinding were underlying factors in this accident.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to:\n\n\n  the provision of maintenance intervention limits on switches\n  the need for a review of the relevant standard to provide assurance that it addresses all potential derailment mechanisms on switches and to clarify its requirements\n  the development of a more accurate method for gauging the angle of switch rails\n  the increased use of automatic lubrication on switches vulnerable to wear\n  the need to review and address the recurrence of factors in this accident which were previously identified by the RAIB in investigations of similar derailment.\n\n\nR182012-120830-Princes-St-Gardens.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Princess Street Gardens\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_princes_street_gardens_edinburgh.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 09:44 hrs on 19 December 2011, a train running from Milford Haven to Manchester struck a lorry and trailer on Llanboidy automatic half barrier (AHB) level crossing, near Whitland in Wales.\n\nThe impact between the train and the lorry caused the lorry to be separated from its trailer and pushed along the track by the train. The lorry driver left his cab prior to the impact but was struck by the trailer and slightly injured during the collision.\n\nThe lorry had stopped on the crossing when the barriers lowered for the approaching train. The train driver saw the lorry when the train was 270 metres away and travelling at 68 mph (109 km/h). The train driver applied the emergency brake, but the train was unable to stop before reaching the crossing. The train was not derailed but 27 passengers were injured in the collision, one seriously, and four received treatment in hospital before being discharged later the same day. The train conductor and the catering host received minor injuries and were treated in hospital and the driver suffered shock.\n\nThe accident occurred because the lorry driver did not telephone the signaller for permission to cross and because local factors encouraged him to take a line towards the right of the road.\n\nRoad signs, in English and Welsh, on the approach to the crossing instructed drivers of large or slow vehicles to phone the signaller for permission to cross the railway. The road signs defined the terms ‘large’ and ‘slow’ and the lorry and trailer were of such a length, and were likely to have been travelling at such a speed, that the lorry fell within the scope of both of these terms.\n\nA number of factors forced the lorry and trailer to use the right-hand side of the road to pass over the crossing; the orientation of the road over the crossing being misaligned with the rest of the road, the position of one of the road traffic light signals and the position of vehicles parked close to the crossing. While travelling slowly over the crossing the barrier on the exit side came down in front of the lorry, causing the lorry driver to stop his vehicle.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations as follows:\n\n\n  Network Rail in conjunction with the ORR to revise the crossing order and reduce the effect of road misalignment at the crossing\n  The ORR to revise its guidance to cover misalignment of the road and the ability for a large vehicle to exit an AHB crossing when the barriers descend\n  Network Rail to revise its risk management process for level crossings to include the effect of road misalignment\n  Network Rail to give guidance to its staff and contractors on where to park when working on or near level crossings\n  Angel Trains to examine how to mitigate the risk to the driver from detachment of cab panels during a collision\n  Alstom and Angel Trains to review the coupler bump stop mounting and retention arrangements.\n\n\nR202012-120927-Llanboidy.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Llanboidy\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_llanboidy_automatic_half_barrier_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 17:37 hrs on 24 January 2013, a cyclist who was using the footpath and bridleway level crossing at Motts Lane, near Witham in Essex, was struck and fatally injured by a passenger train travelling at almost 100 miles per hour (160 kilometres per hour).\n\nIt was dark at the time. The red/green lights provided at the crossing to indicate the approach of trains were showing red, and the associated audible warning was sounding. The cyclist was unaware that the train was so close to the crossing, probably because it was difficult to pick out the train’s headlight amongst the lights of Witham station, about 700 metres from the crossing.\n\nThe cyclist rode onto the crossing into the path of the train, although the lights were showing red. Although it is not possible to know why he did this, it may have been because he was used to seeing the lights at red for long periods before trains arrived at the crossing, and decided for himself whether it was safe to cross. The lights showed red for long periods because there were deficiencies in the design of the railway signalling system in the area, and it was not being used as it was designed to be.\n\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations, addressed to Network Rail, which cover:\n\n\n  the review and reduction of long waiting times at automatic level crossings\n  the design and checking of software which is used for automatic route setting in signalling control centres\n  minimising the effect of local variations in the way trains are signalled that may affect the length of the periods during which red lights are displayed at level crossings\n  modification of risk management processes for crossings with miniature stop lights to include allowance for the length of time that the red lights show.\n\n\nR012014-140114-Motts-Lane.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Motts Lane level crossing  \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_motts_lane_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  A passenger train passing the site of track maintenance work at Washwood Heath, Birmingham on 6 March 2010 struck a piece of rail being moved as part of the maintenance work. The front and lower side of the train were damaged by the impact and the driver of the train was slightly injured. None of the passengers on the train or workers on the site were injured.\n\nThe accident was caused by a combination of factors including:\n\n\n  the unsafe system of work adopted for the maintenance work did not comply with the rule book or Network Rail’s procedures\n  the supervisor in charge of the relaying work was not adequately managed and was not challenged over his unsafe method of work\n  the lack of effective review of the safe system of work at the planning and implementation stages.\n\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail, the owners of the infrastructure. The recommendations relate to independent checking of safe systems of work, supervision of staff at the Saltley infrastructure maintenance delivery unit (IMDU), the training and assessment of existing staff for safety leadership roles and changes to operating procedures.

'\n  On 1 June 2009, train 2C31 was travelling on the Maryport and Carlisle section of the Cumbrian Coast line, heading towards Carlisle.  The driver of train 2C31 had been requested to visually examine the line between Dalston and Cummersdale near Carlisle to find a defect in the track which had been reported by the driver of the preceding train, 2C47, to the signaller.  While scanning the line, the driver of train 2C31 noticed a severe track buckle approximately 200 metres ahead.  He applied the emergency brake but was unable to stop before the buckle.  The leading bogie of train 2C31 derailed and ran on for approximately 25 metres. \n\nThere were no injuries among the passengers and crew on board.  Damage to the single car train was principally around the leading bogie and surrounding vehicle body.  Damage to the track was confined to a length of about 30 metres around the point of derailment, however, more extensive repairs to stabilise the track over a distance of approximately 1.6 km were carried out. \n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was flange climb of the right leading wheel as train 2C31 ran over the severe track buckle.\n\nThe causal factors which led to the derailment of train 2C31 include: the warm weather and insufficient expansion gaps in the jointed track; control of rail creep in the area of the derailment was not effective; the tight joints in the vicinity of the derailment site were not reported; the track was disturbed at a naturally weak point on the day before the derailment; a lack of recognition of the risk being imported by disturbing the track; the speed of train 2C31; and communications and instructions passed between the signaller and driver.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations concerning improved standards for the maintenance and repair of jointed track; identifying and monitoring sections of jointed track on the network which have similar characteristics to the track which buckled at Cummersdale; re-briefing of signallers on the correct actions to take when a track defect has been reported which could endanger a train; introduction of a specific requirement in the Rule Book for train drivers to clarify with the signaller what the maximum speed should be when examining the line.\n\nR062010-100325-Cummersdale.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Cummersdale\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_of_a_passenger_train_near_cummersdale.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 10:41 hrs on 24 June 2014, a track worker was struck by a passenger train travelling at about 80 mph (129 km/h), near Redhill. The accident occurred on a section of the main line between Brighton and London known as the Up Quarry line. He was the leader of a team of twelve people who were fitting emergency clamp plates to lengths of rail where cracks had been identified during an earlier inspection. The accident happened on the top of an embankment about ten metres high, on a section of line where trains can travel at up to 90 mph (145 km/h).\n\nThe team were doing the work of fitting clamp plates to one of the two lines at the site while trains continued to run on both lines. They were protected by lookouts, whom the controller of site safety (COSS) had positioned at the site and at some distance away on both sides of the site of work, to warn the team of the approach of a train in sufficient time for them to stop work and move to a position of safety before the train arrived. At the time the accident occurred, the work had been in progress for about forty minutes. The other members of the team had completed their work, and the team leader was engaged in taking measurements for the lengths of replacement rail that would be required at the site. The lookouts had warned the team of the approach of a southbound train, and a short time after this had passed, and before the COSS had given permission for anyone to return to the track, the lookouts gave another warning, for a northbound train.\n\nAt about the time this warning was given, the team leader began to walk along the side of the line, with his back to the approaching northbound train. As he walked, he moved closer to the Up Quarry line, and the train struck him on his right shoulder and threw him down the side of the embankment. Other members of the team gave him first-aid treatment and called the emergency services, and an air ambulance helicopter landed on the railway. The casualty was airlifted to hospital, but he had suffered life-changing injuries.\n\nThe RAIB’s investigation found that the position of safety the team were using was not adequate because there was no level place to stand, clear of the line. The team leader was unaware of the imminent danger from the approaching train.\n\nThe RAIB has identified three learning points and made three recommendations arising from this investigation. The learning points relate to staff speaking up if they feel unsafe, the need for train drivers to sound a warning as they approach each group of workers who are on or near the track, and the importance of first-aid training for staff working in high-risk areas. The recommendations are all addressed to Network Rail and cover suitable lineside positions of safety, the company’s policy on first aid at work, and the training of people who act as lookouts.\n\nR062015_150615_Redhill\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Redhill \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/serious_accident_near_redhill.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 17:30 hrs on 6 May 2009 train number 2K74, the 17:08 hrs service from Newbury to Bedwyn, struck a pedestrian on the footpath level crossing known as Fairfield crossing, near the village of Little Bedwyn, Wiltshire.  The pedestrian, who was crossing from the north-west side of the railway, was fatally injured. \n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian walked onto the crossing as the train approached and was unable to get clear in time to avoid being struck.\n\nThe causal factors which led to the accident were: that (although there is no direct evidence) as she approached the crossing, she may have been distracted when making her decision to cross the line by the presence of her dogs; the way that pedestrians approaching the crossing may have used the longer view of approaching trains obtainable from a position a short distance back from the gate on the up side; the absence of ‘whistle’ boards on the approach to the crossing.\n\nA possible contributory factor was the absence of an adequate risk assessment for the level crossing and an underlying factor was the difficulty of closing the level crossing, and its continued availability to members of the public as a footpath\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail concerning the way it manages the risk to users of footpath crossings; modification of the level crossing risk model to improve its sensitivity to low sighting times; and provision of guidance to its staff assessing crossings on methods of marking the point at which level crossing users should stand to get the best view to enable them to make their decision to cross the track.\n\nR082010-100512-Bedwyn.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bedwyn (Fairfield) \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_fairfield_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Friday 23 February 2007 a Virgin West Coast train from London Euston to Glasgow derailed on 2B points at Lambrigg, near Grayrigg in Cumbria, while travelling at 95mph. All nine carriages of the Class 390 Pendolino were derailed. There were at least 105 passengers and four crew on board. One passenger was fatally injured, 28 passengers, the train driver and one other crew member were seriously injured, and 59 passengers received minor injuries.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was 2B points being in a degraded and unsafe state, forcing the train onto a reducing gauge between the rails and causing it to derail. Points 2B came to be in an unsafe condition through a combination of failures of the three stretcher bars and the lock stretcher bar, and their fastenings. This allowed the left-hand switch rail to move into an unsafe position close to the stock rail, without losing signalling detection.\n\nAt this stage of the investigation, it has been established that the following have no relevance to the cause of the derailment:\n\n\n  the way in which the train was driven; \n  the actions of the signaller at Carlisle; \n  the design and condition of the train; \n  the signalling system, including the points control and detection mechanism; \n  the condition of the track on the approach to the points; and\n  the condition of the earthworks on and around the railway. \n\n\nImmediately after the accident Network Rail carried out an extensive check of points on their system to ensure there were no other stretcher bars in a similar state. As a result of the emerging findings from the investigation, the RAIB issued an urgent safety advice on 6 June 2007 to Network Rail, and also to Nexus, Northern Ireland Railways and London Underground, who all use a similar design of points. As part of their response to this advice, Network Rail undertook a further examination of the 120 sets of points most similar to 2B points. Some faults were found, and in six cases, Network Rail imposed speed restrictions until faults to the track gauge, free wheel clearance and stretcher bars were rectified.\n\nContinuing Work\n\nThe RAIB has not yet fully concluded the causal and contributory factors of the derailment. The report outlines the current status of the investigation and areas of ongoing work, which include the following:\n\n\n  concluding the study into the cause of injuries to the passengers and crew; \n  concluding the investigation into the maintenance and inspection practices and systems at points, at both a national and local level, to determine their relevance to the derailment; \n  considering how the overall balance of design, environment, usage, inspection and maintenance of the specific points system has been addressed by the industry, and the management of these factors through Network Rail’s processes and standards; \n  considering the relevance and possible effects of the implementation of the recommendations made after the Potters Bar accident on the points at Lambrigg. \n\n\nThe timing of the next report by the RAIB is dependent on completing the work listed above. The RAIB currently expects to publish this in second half of 2008.\n\nThe RAIB’s final report will make recommendations to improve safety.\n\n \nIR22007-071003-Grayrigg.pdf \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/raib_progress_report_into_a_derailment_at_grayrigg_cumbria_on_23_february_2007.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  \nAt 14:48 hrs on Saturday 26 October 2013, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Barratt’s Lane No.2 footpath crossing, at Attenborough near Nottingham. \n\nThe train was travelling from Nottingham towards Birmingham. At the same time, a London to Nottingham train was slowly approaching the crossing from the other direction. It is likely that the pedestrian had concentrated her attention on the London train and did not notice the train approaching from the Nottingham direction. \n\nBoth trains were fitted with forward facing closed circuit television equipment and the recording from the London to Nottingham train showed that the pedestrian approached the crossing and waited at the gate for 17 seconds before opening it; she started to cross the line 9 seconds later (the train was stopped at a red signal for part of this time). It is most likely that, having seen the London train stopped at the signal, she waited until she had determined that the train was not moving before deciding to cross the line. The sighting distances in both directions were adequate.\n\nNetwork Rail had assessed the risk at the crossing, in accordance with its standard procedures, and, because the risk rating was relatively high, discussed the options for reducing this risk at a meeting with the highway authority. The chosen option was to divert the footpath and close the crossing. This had not been implemented at the time of the accident as the route of the proposed diversion was obstructed by an equipment room. The room contained signalling equipment that did not become redundant until completion of the Nottingham station resignalling project at the end of August 2013. The equipment room was demolished and the footpath diverted after the accident.\n\nThe RAIB has identified one learning point and has made no recommendations. \n\n140821-R182014-Barratts-Lane.pdf (4,608.06 kb) \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_barratt’s_lane_no_2_footpath_crossing_attenborough_nottingham.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Friday 04 November a train travelling on the West Coast Main Line derailed after running into a landslip at a cutting at Oubeck North. The trailing wheelset of the leading bogie derailed and the train travelled a further 1430m before coming to rest in an upright position. There were no injuries as a result of this derailment but track damage was sustained.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the train running into material deposited on the track as a result of the cutting landslip. This failed due to the volume of water flowing through a concealed field drain into the slope, which was greater than usual due to the wet period over the preceding two weeks and excessive rain during the previous day. The root cause was that the field drain was hidden from view and therefore the infrastructure owner was unaware of it.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation. The primary focus of the recommendations was on modifying existing drainage arrangements at Oubeck and identifying, prioritising and managing other cutting slopes prone to risks of earth flow due to drainage from neighbouring property.\n\nR192006-061102-Oubeck.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Oubeck North\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_oubeck_north.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 28 June 2006 a Freightliner Heavy Haul coal train from Redcar to West Burton derailed on a set of points at Maltby North. Three wagons derailed but they remained upright and did not spill their loads. There were no injuries but 80m of track was damaged.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the points moving position as the train traversed them. One causal factor was the non-implementation of ‘time of operation locking’ for these points, despite it being specified. Although they cannot be proven positively, other causal factors were the likelihood that the driver passed the signal at danger, and that the signaller changed the points just as the train passed over them. There were also three contributory factors.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\n\n\n  the design of the signalling system at Maltby \n  signallers’ roster patterns\n  implementing appropriate control measures at similar signalling installations where necessary.\n\n\nR242007-070718-Maltby.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Maltby North\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_maltby_north.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 16:38 hrs on Monday 22 August 2007 First Great Western passenger train 1W47, travelling from London Paddington to Worcester Shrub Hill, passed a signed at danger to the north of Didcot Parkway station. At the same time First Great Western train 2P66, travelling from Oxford to London Paddington, was just passing clear of the junction ahead.\n\nDespite the correct operation of the Train Protection Warning System in the London to Worcester service train, which applied the emergency brake, the train did not come to a standstill until it had entered the junction. The time that had elapsed between the back of train 2P66 clearing the Didcot North junction and the arrival of train 1W47 was 13 seconds. There were no casualties, and no damage, as a result.\n\nThe RAIB’s investigation identified that the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver did not respond correctly to the aspect of the previous caution signal. Possible causal factors involved the driver’s expectation of the signalling system’s performance, his perception of the situation he was in, external distraction and the braking performance of the train relative to that assumed in the design of the Train Protection Warning System. Underlying factors include Network Rail’s response to a previous incident, and the recommendations that arose from it.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident RAIB has made nine recommendations relating to risk assessments for junction signals, standards for train braking performance and driving policy and associated competence management systems.\n\nR232008-081120-Didcot.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Didcot North Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/signal_passed_at_danger_didcot_north_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 12:43 hrs on 30 March 2009 a passenger train from Richmond to Stratford, travelling at about 15 mph (25 km/h), struck a railway worker on the track at Dalston Junction, north London. The track worker was struck on the head and thrown to the ground. He was taken to hospital, but was not seriously injured and has since made a full recovery.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the track worker did not move clear of the line in response to a warning sounded by an approaching train.\n\nRAIB’s investigation identified a number of factors that contributed to the accident:\n\n\n  the unfamiliarity of some of the workers with the area and lack of local knowledge of the staff involved in planning the work\n  the way in which the worker and his supervisor worked with each other\n  deficiencies in the safety management system of Carillion Rail (the rail division of Carillion Construction Ltd), in particular the way in which this project was managed in its early stages\n  the absence of clear guidance in the Rule Book about lookout duties around junctions.\n\n\nSome of the factors relevant to this accident were the subject of recommendations arising from previous RAIB investigations into accidents to track workers. These recommendations, and the status of the actions taken by the railway industry to implement them, are detailed in the report.

'\n  At about 19:36 hrs on 30 November 2011 a car that was being driven on the B1113 Stowmarket Road, towards the village of Old Newton in Suffolk, left the carriageway and passed through the wire fence onto the railway line north of Stowmarket.\n\nThe driver of the car was injured, but was able to escape to a place of safety, and reported the accident to Suffolk Police. A short time later the car was struck by the 18:43 hrs Cambridge to Ipswich train. Fortunately the train did not derail and neither passengers nor members of the train crew were physically injured.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident on the highway was that the driver of the car lost control of his vehicle. The subsequent collision with the train occurred because the car came to rest in a position where it was obstructing the railway line and there was insufficient time to stop the train.\n\nSuffolk County Council had undertaken a risk assessment in 2005 and assessed the risk of road vehicle incursion at the location where the accident occurred. It had not implemented steps to control the risk of incursion. Network Rail was also aware of the risk at the location, but had no process in place to monitor the actions of local highway authorities to address the risk of road vehicle incursions and had assumed that Suffolk County Council was taking suitable actions.\n\nA number of underlying factors were identified which showed Network Rail’s awareness of road vehicle incursion incident sites was limited, and the joint risk management process adopted by Network Rail and Suffolk County Council in 2003 (following the fatal train accident at Great Heck in 2001) had not been completed. As a consequence, the investigation identified that there were nine locations within Suffolk where action to reduce RVI risk had still to be taken. Network Rail has identified over 200 sites on the national rail network where action has still to be taken to reduce the risk of road vehicle incursion.\n\nIt was also found that the Department for Transport’s (DfT) monitoring of the progress to mitigate the risk at known sites with significant road vehicle incursion risk was not effective, nor did it emphasise to local highway authorities and Network Rail the requirement to complete such works. The RAIB considers that regulatory oversight by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) of works to address the risk of road vehicle incursion was affected by a lack of clarity as to which body has enforcement powers to require local highway authorities to take action.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to Suffolk County Council. These cover:\n\n\n  the need for an independent review of the actions it has taken since the accident to address the deficiencies in its process for the management of road vehicle incursion risk; and\n  the need to improve the flow of information to parish and district councils and the police on related matters.\n\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. These cover:\n\n\n  a review of the current data on road vehicle incursion sites; and\n  improvements to the way road vehicle incursion risk is monitored.\n\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to the ORR and HSE. This covers the need to clarify which body has regulatory and enforcement responsibility relating to the management of road vehicle incursion risk.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to the Department for Transport. These cover:\n\n\n  the need to monitor progress with the implementation of risk mitigation measures at road vehicle incursion sites;\n  establishment of a mechanism for the lessons learnt from this investigation to be disseminated to other local highway authorities\n  improving the exchange of information that is relevant to the risk of road vehicle incursion\n  gathering intelligence on high risk road vehicle incursion locations as an input to emergency planning.\n\n\nR252012-121121-Stowmarket-Road.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Stowmarket Road \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_between_car_and_train_at_stowmarket_road.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Saturday 29 July 2006 a freight train stopped at a signal near Deal station in Kent. Whilst checking the brakes of one of the wagons, the driver elected to cross between that wagon and the wagon behind to reach the other side of the train. In doing so, he came into simultaneous contact with the live conductor rail and the buffer of the wagon, and was fatally injured.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the driver’s leg coming into contact with a live conductor rail at the same time as his arm was in contact with the buffer, thus causing an electric shock. Causal factors were the driver’s decision to pass between two wagons and a subsequent misjudgement, loss of balance or slip by the driver. There were two further possible causal factors, one contributory factor and four factors that may have influenced the behaviour of the driver.\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  conductor rail safety;\n  clarification of rules and publications;\n  the training and briefing of staff;\n  maintenance of rolling stock; and\n  the long term development of simplified isolation arrangements.\n\n\nR142007-070529-Deal.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses. \n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Deal\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_involving_a_train_driver_deal.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  During the evening of 14 November 2009, the foundations of a Victorian bridge carrying the railway over the River Crane near Feltham in West London failed without warning, causing part of the bridge to subside. The first indication of a problem was a track defect reported by a train driver crossing the bridge on the up line. Track maintenance staff, called to the site, immediately blocked the up line to all traffic when they became aware of a serious defect with the bridge. The down line was blocked shortly afterwards. \n\nA total of 21 trains crossed the failing bridge between the first report and closure of the line. There was no derailment and no injuries occurred.\n\nThe immediate cause was that the east abutment of bridge 48 was undermined by scour - the removal of material by the action of flowing water.\n\nThe causal factors were: the obstruction of the watercourse, which channelled the flow towards the east abutment, increasing its velocity and making it more likely that scour would occur; Network Rail being unaware of the obstruction and therefore not taking action to mitigate the risk of scour; and the vulnerability of the east abutment of the bridge to undermining by scour.\n\nA contributory factor was the lack of a mechanism to encourage members of the public who were aware of the obstruction to report it to Network Rail.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail concerning the management of structures, and one recommendation to the Environment Agency concerning notification to railway infrastructure owners when obstructions are found against a structure.\n\nR172010-100923-Feltham.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Feltham \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/failure_of_a_railway_bridge_near_feltham.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 17.30 hours on 22 January 2008 the driver of a freight train reporting number 6E62 spotted a person appearing from trackside vegetation at West Lodge crossing. The driver sounded his horn immediately and continuously as he walked the few steps to the crossing and onto the line.\n\nThe person, was between the rails of the up line and had taken no avoiding action when the train struck him. The train driver stopped sounding his horn and applied the brake, with the train coming to a standstill 583 metres beyond the point of collision. The person involved suffered immediate fatal injuries.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident as the person walking onto the track as the train approached.\n\nThe investigation found that the person could not have used the crossing safely because:\n\n\n  he had insufficient sighting distance for the approach of trains\n  he may not have heard the train over traffic noise from a nearby trunk road\n  he may not have discerned the crossing and its warning signs from their surroundings in darkness. \n\n\nNetwork Rail was responsible for inspecting and assessing West Lodge crossing. Prior to the accident they identified insufficient sighting distance and proposed improvements, but never acted upon them. The RAIB has not been able to ascertain a reason why this was not done.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB have made four recommendations targeted at Network Rail. These relate to making West Lodge and any similar crossings safe for pedestrians and revising management systems, inspections and assessments to confirm that foreseeable circumstances are considered, findings are acted upon and similar accidents are prevented.\n\nR012009-090120-West-Lodge.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for West Lodge\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_west_lodge_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 13 November 2005, a passenger train and a car at collided at Swainsthorpe level crossing, near Norwich, . Regrettably, the driver of the car was killed. The train was not derailed and none of the passengers or traincrew was injured.\n\nRAIB investigated the performance of the level crossing equipment and the crash worthiness and fire resistance of the train as it became apparent early in the investigation that the car was driven onto the level crossing after the road traffic light signals had been seen to start flashing and the crossing booms had lowered. The reasons why the car was driven onto the crossing are outside the scope of our investigation.\n\nThe driving and maintenance of the train and the operation of the level crossing did not contribute to the collision. There was no action that the train driver could have taken to prevent the collision occurring. The train performed well in the areas of both crash worthiness and fire performance.\n\nNo recommendations are made as a result of this investigation.\n\nR032006-060328-Swainsthorpe.pdf\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_swainsthorpe_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 00:11 hrs on 21 July 2013, a passenger train operated by Greater Anglia carrying 35 passengers collided at 8 mph (13 km/h) with a train stabled in platform 6 at Norwich station. As a result of the collision, eight passengers with injuries were taken to hospital.\n\nRAIB concluded that the accident occurred because during the last 20 seconds of the driver’s approach to the station, he either had a lapse in concentration or a microsleep.\n\nRAIB identified some factors which may explain the driver’s possible lapse in concentration (ie the noise made by the passengers immediately behind his cab and the various thoughts occupying his attention at the time of the approach). RAIB also found that the driver had a previous operational history indicative that he was prone to lapses in concentration, and that this had not been identified by Greater Anglia’s competence management system.\n\nGreater Anglia’s investigations of the previous incidents that the driver had been involved in had not raised any concerns about the driver’s ability to maintain concentration. This was because the driver manager who carried out the investigation had not been trained to consider that incidents, seemingly different in nature, could be linked by underlying behavioural issues. Opportunities to formally review the driver’s operational history were missed and this was also not identified by the internal audits conducted by Greater Anglia.\n\nFurthermore, the driver was tired through a short-term lack of sleep, and his performance might also have been affected by the prescribed medication that he was taking. These could have been other factors leading to a lapse in concentration, or they could have led to the driver having a microsleep.\n\nRAIB has identified two learning points and made five recommendations as a result of its investigation. The learning points relate to the importance of reporting all incidents to signallers, and the importance of providing occupational health physicians with all relevant medical information during consultation.\n\nFour recommendations are addressed to Greater Anglia with respect to its competence management system, its accident and incident investigation procedures, its auditing processes and its fatigue management system. A further recommendation is addressed to Network Rail, with the support of Greater Anglia, to understand and mitigate the risk associated with permissive train movements at Norwich station.\n\nR092014-140501-Norwich.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Norwich\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_norwich.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  In the early hours of 10 August 2007, two wagons in a container train operated by Freightliner Group Ltd derailed at Duddeston Junction in Birmingham. No one was injured in the derailment. The wagons were travelling at 15 mph (24 km/h) at the time of the derailment. However, the derailed wagons obstructed one adjacent line and a container fell from one of the wagons onto another nearby line. Both adjacent lines were open to traffic and therefore the accident had the potential to be more serious.\n\nThe accident was a result of a combination of undetected twists in the track, and one of the derailed wagons having been loaded very unevenly.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations to Freightliner and two to Network Rail. The recommendations cover measures for improved detection of unevenly loaded container wagons, improved information on container wagons’ derailment resistance, and changes to the procurement process for wagons.\n\nThe issues relating to track maintenance in this accident are covered by a previous RAIB recommendation that resulted from RAIB’s recent investigation into a derailment at King Edward Bridge, Newcastle on Tyne, reported on in January 2008.\n\nR162008-080731-Duddeston.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Duddeston Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_duddeston_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 23:20 hrs on 9 March 2008, a ‘low ride’ road rail excavator and two road rail wagons derailed. A ‘low ride’ road rail excavator is a machine that shares its weight between its road and rail wheels during on track operation; the rail wheels guide the machine along the track while the road wheels provide the means of traction and braking.\n\nThe excavator derailed after its operator transferred weight from its rail to its road wheels. He did this because the track gradient and overloaded wagons increased the amount of traction he required, while the traction available to him was reduced by:\n\n\n  rainwater that had reduced adhesion between the rubber road tyres and the steel rails\n  uncompensated tyre wear that transferred weight, originally applied through the road wheels, to the rail wheels.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made four recommendations.\n\nOne recommendation is targeted at the new owners of the road rail excavator, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, and requires it to maintain and operate the excavator so that it distributes its weight appropriately between road and rail wheels.\n\nThe remaining recommendations are targeted at Northern Ireland Railways and require them to identify and eliminate or mitigate the factors that affect the safe operation of road rail vehicles, brief this process to the members of staff who have responsibility for the safety of vehicle movements on track, and ensure road rail vehicles and their associated wagons are inspected and assessed before permitting operation on their infrastructure.\n\n \nR032009-090211-Terryhoogan.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Terryhoogan bog \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_terryhoogan.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  RAIB has reviewed the 97 pedestrian station crossings across the UK. Many are located on minor routes in rural locations. However, a number remain on busy lines, such as that located at Elsenham.\n\nRAIB carried out an analysis of the risks at station pedestrian crossings. The conclusions from this analysis are:\n\n\n  The overall levels of individual risk are sufficiently high to justify a detailed risk assessment for each station pedestrian crossing. In cases where the individual risk to the most exposed user is found to be intolerable, immediate action should be taken to reduce the risk. \n  The overall risk to society posed by station pedestrian crossings is unlikely to justify the expenditure needed to upgrade safety measures across the entire network. However, it is sufficient to justify a long term programme for the upgrading of station pedestrian crossings where it is reasonably practical to do so. \n\n\nSummary of fatal accident at Elsenham Station\n\nOn Saturday 03 December 2005 two girls were struck by a fast moving train on the pedestrian level crossing at Elsenham station in Cambridgeshire. Both girls were killed. Immediately prior to the accident, the two girls had purchased tickets from the booking office on the east side of the line and were in the process of walking to the opposite platform.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the two girls stepping into the path of the approaching train, despite the continued display of a red light and the sounding of an audible alarm. It is likely that the accident occurred due to the girls’ focus of attention on a train to Cambridge and their consequent failure to perceive the risk from trains in the opposite direction.\n\nFactors that contributed to the accident were the design of the crossing at Elsenham, which did not physically prevent users from opening the gate, and the crossing’s warning signs and systems which did not deter the girls from stepping into the path of the train. In addition, it is possible the presence of a ticket machine on both platforms would have avoided the need for the girls to cross the line.\n\nRAIB has made eight recommendations regarding general station pedestrian crossing issues. Six are made to Network Rail, one to the Office of Rail Regulation and one to Station Operators. These recommendations relate to:\n\n\n  the development of Network Rail’s methods of risk management to address the particular hazards associated with station pedestrian crossings\n  the development of a programme for upgrading station pedestrian crossings where it is reasonably practicable to do so\n  the competence of Network Rail staff carrying out risk assessments\n  the need for a review and update of design guidance and standards relating to the design of station pedestrian crossings taking into account a modern understanding of human factors and the potential of recent technological developments\n  the enhancement of signage to remind users of the risk of a second train arriving\n  the replacement of existing miniature warning lights with those utilising LED technology\n  the provision of additional facilities to minimise the need for passengers to cross the line\n  the development of a clearly defined and validated register of all foot crossings at stations on the network\n\n\nRAIB has made two specific recommendations to Network Rail in relation to the crossing at Elsenham. These relate to:\n\n\n  the locking of the pedestrian crossing gates before signals are cleared for the approach of trains; \n  if necessary for the avoidance of delays, the construction of a footbridge.\n\n\n \nR232006-061211-Elsenham.pdf edit\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Elsenham station \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/investigation_into_station_pedestrian_crossings.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 18 August 2006 a freight train travelling from Purley yard to Acton yard passed signal T172 at danger by 35 metres, following a shunting move at Purley station. The freight train was stopped by a Train Protection Warning System (TPWS) intervention. The driver immediately reset the equipment without speaking to the signaller, and continued his journey. The freight train was finally stopped by the driver at signal T160 at Purley Oaks station, which had been changed to show a red aspect. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.\n\nThe immediate cause of the Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) was that the freight train driver incorrectly assumed that the adjacent signal, which was green, applied to him. The main causal factors of the SPAD were the driver positioning his locomotive incorrectly, and that no specific stop marker had been provided.\n\nThe immediate cause of the resetting of the TPWS incident was that the driver did not apply proper procedures after the intervention. The main causal factors were driver confusion, the incorrect assumption that an adjacent signal applied to his line, and the driver’s lack of awareness and understanding of TPWS.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\n\n\n  train shunting procedures at Purley station; \n  training for TPWS procedures\n  procedures for checking local ‘method of work’ instructions\n  Railway Group standards on TPWS procedures\n  safety procedures for shunters at Purley station.\n\n\nR272007-070808-Purley.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Purley\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/signal_passed_at_danger_purley.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 12 September 2006 at approximately 06:03hrs, a ‘one’ train service from Norwich to Cambridge was travelling at 87 mph when it struck a dislodged ‘Holdfast’ level crossing surface panel at Croxton level crossing and derailed. The train ran for a further 463 metres before it stopped. There were no injuries on the train, but a car driver suffered a whiplash injury after colliding with the panel shortly before the train arrived. The line was closed for the day to allow repairs to the track and the fitting of a new panel in the level crossing.\n\nThe investigation identified that a tanker-trailer lorry had dislodged the panel nine minutes before the arrival of the train. This was because;\n\n\n  the panel was inadequately supported because the panels became shorter due to road traffic loading and the sleepers under the crossing were incorrectly positioned\n  an assessment of the application of the panels had not been carried out to required standards\n  Croxton level crossing was not suitable, by Network Rail’s own processes, for the installation of a panel system\n  maintenance crews had not acted appropriately after previous reports of the panel not being secure.\n\n\nRAIB has made eleven recommendations relating to the installation and monitoring of panel level crossings.\n\nNetwork Rail has carried out level crossing panel inspections to correct any such deficiencies on the network and improved staff training in the maintenance, standards and risks associated with these crossings.\n\nR112008-080513-Croxton.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Croxton level crossing \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_croxton_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On the evening of 30 January 2015, the 19:53 hrs South West Trains service from Windsor & Eton Riverside to London Waterloo left its origin station on time. After the train had travelled about 400 metres, there was a small explosion under the sixth carriage, followed by about 22 seconds of severe electrical arcing.\n\nThe train, which was formed of two class 458/5 electric multiple units (ten carriages), was travelling at about 14 mph (23 km/h) at the time. The brakes applied because of damage to air pipes, and the train stopped very rapidly. Some smoke entered the carriages through ventilators. There were two passengers in the sixth carriage, and they moved quickly into another part of the train. The driver contacted the signaller by radio to ask for the electric power to be switched off. While he was doing this, the floor of the sixth carriage was penetrated by fire, and smoke rapidly filled the vehicle. A few minutes after this, the lights in the rear five carriages went out.\n\nThere were 19 passengers on the train. Some of them operated the emergency door release in the rear carriage, got down onto the track, and walked back to Windsor station. Railway staff later evacuated the remaining passengers to the track, and helped them walk back to the station. The fire brigade were called, and confirmed by 20:50 hrs that the fire was out. None of the passengers were hurt, but the guard of the train was taken to hospital and treated for smoke inhalation.\n\nThe fire occurred because a joint between three power cables, located under the floor of the sixth carriage, had not been secured correctly when the carriage was reassembled after being rebuilt and refurbished in 2014. Electrical arcing had developed at the loose joint, and this damaged the ends of the cables and eventually led to the arcing which badly damaged the structure of the train. This in turn caused a fire that penetrated the floor.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations. One, addressed to Wabtec Rail Ltd, covers the review and improvement of quality assurance arrangements at the factory where the refurbishment work was done. The second, addressed to Network Rail, relates to the need for changes to the rules relating to the conditions under which passengers are evacuated from trains after incidents. The third and fourth, addressed to South West Trains, concern the way in which the emergency lighting on the trains is configured to operate in the event of a loss of external power, and the need to review the risks associated with power cables and the joints between them. The investigation also identified four learning points for the railway industry, relating to the design of electrical junction boxes, the need for train crew to be fully aware of how on-train equipment works, the organisation of train conversion projects, and the importance of ensuring that records relating to train design are accurate and kept up-to-date.\n\nR182015_151021_Windsor\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Windsor & Eaton Riverside\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/arcing_and_fire_at_windsor_&_eton_riverside.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 4 April 2008, as the 17:06 hrs Cheriton to Coquelles passenger shuttle departed from the UK terminal of the Channel Tunnel, a road coach moved within the rail vehicle.\n\nThe driver of the coach was injured as he attempted to arrest the movement of the coach. There were no other injuries, although the position of passengers behind the coach immediately before it moved gave rise to the potential for injury.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified the immediate cause as the coach not being sufficiently restrained against movement. It has not been possible to establish with certainty the circumstances which led to this situation, but the absence of the correct chocks and the difficulty of the shuttle crew in confirming the state of the controls of a road vehicle possibly contributed to the cause of the accident.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations to Eurotunnel, relating to the availability of the correct chocks, the communications with coach drivers, and to warning passengers not to remain in the vehicle roadway during the transit of the Channel Tunnel.\n\nR082009-090319-Eurotunnel.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Channel Tunnel (2009). \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/uncontrolled_movement_of_a_road_vehicle_in_a_channel_tunnel_passenger_shuttle_train.txt','Heavy rail'

The local signaller at Washwood Heath no1 frame saw and heard the derailment and contacted the signaller at Saltley signal box to stop the train. There was limited damage to the derailed wagon. There were no injuries.\n\nThe cause of the derailment was a high level of bogie rotational resistance arising from the design and condition of the wagon’s side bearer assembly. This caused wheel unloading when the wagon encountered track twist.\n\nThe process of design scrutiny did not correctly identify the factors that influence the dynamic performance of the FAA wagon when exposed to track twist.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of their investigation, aimed at:\n\n\n  modification certification and maintenance of FAA wagons.\n\n\nR392007-071121-Washwood-Heath.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Washwood Heath \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_washwood_heath.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 10 April 2011, at around 12:30 hrs, a cardan shaft fell from an empty class 142 passenger train travelling through Durham station at 75 mph (120 km/h). The train ran for a distance of approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) before being stopped. A member of the public standing on a platform suffered a minor injury from ballast thrown up as the cardan shaft fell onto the track; the train suffered damage, including loss of diesel fuel.\n\nThe immediate cause of the detachment was the complete fracture of a final drive input shaft. The input shaft fractured because a seized input bearing generated a large amount of frictional heat between the shaft and bearing. The input shaft was locally heated to a temperature at which its strength was reduced so that it could no longer carry its normal loading.\n\nRAIB established that the seizure of the bearing was due to the setup of the bearings during overhaul which resulted in a lack of end float in the bearings when in operation. The final drive failure was not detected by the checks which were in place to identify the onset of such failures. The detached cardan shaft was not retained by its safety loops.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations to Northern Rail and owners of class 14x vehicles. Two recommendations relate to reviewing the end float and alignment requirements for the class 14x final drives and ensuring that any changes to the setup of safety critical components are validated. One recommendation covers the detection of impending final drive failures. The fourth recommendation relates to the final drive post-overhaul testing and the fifth covers the provision of key design information to overhaul and maintenance contractors. The final recommendation relates to the completion of the review work associated with the events in the immediate aftermath of the accident.\n\nR122012-120702-Durham.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Durham\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/detachment_of_a_cardan_shaft_at_durham_station.txt','Heavy rail'

At the time the train passed, the crossing keeper was attempting to close the gates to the road.\n\nThere were no injuries or damage caused in either incident.\n\nThe immediate cause of both incidents was that the signal protecting the level crossing showed clear aspect for the passage of trains whilst the level crossing gates were open to the road. Two causal factors were the lack of interlocking between the signals and the level crossing’s gates, and human error in failing to follow the procedure for working the crossing.

'\n  At 20:55 hrs on Sunday 6 June 2010, the 18:20 hrs train from Glasgow Queen Street to Oban struck a boulder that had fallen onto the track just west of the station at Falls of Cruachan, in the Pass of Brander, on the line from Crianlarich to Oban. The boulder lifted up the front coach of the two-coach train and derailed it to the left and down an embankment. The leading bogie of the rear coach came to a stand supported by the boulder with the rear bogie still on the track.\n\nOf the 64 passengers and three crew on the train, eight of the passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries.\n\nThe boulder had fallen down the cutting slope onto the railway from within the railway boundary. It had become insecure due to the growth of tree roots around it, which gradually prised it from its stable position, and soil erosion from normal rainfall. Network Rail’s earthworks management system applied to cutting slopes had not identified the hazard of loose boulders in the area that the accident occurred.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to the management of earthworks. These include:\n\n\n  improving the clearance of vegetation growing on earthworks so that hazards to the safety of railway operation can be identified\n  improvements to the collection of slope data so that a full appreciation of the condition of slopes is obtained\n  improvements to the process for the implementation of remediation works to prevent future earthworks failures.\n\n\nA further recommendation has been made relating to the prevention of lighting diffusers and other saloon panels on rolling stock becoming displaced during accidents.\n\nR112011-110714-Falls-of-Cruachan.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Falls of Cruachan\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_falls_of_cruachan_argyll.txt','Heavy rail'

No-one was hurt.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the combination of the container and the type of wagon it had been loaded onto was too high for the route on which the train was travelling, allowing the left-hand top corner of the container to strike the canopy.\n\nThe system for identifying container types and container / wagon combinations was prone to human error, in that:\n\n\n  the container and wagon combination involved was not permitted on the route the train took\n  incorrect information about the container was recorded by the train preparer at Wakefield, who did not correctly identify during his train examination the container type was incorrect for that particular wagon and route\n  the decision of staff at Southampton to change the type code of the container on the computer system without checking with the Wakefield terminal\n  the gauge to identify over-size trains at Wakefield was not operational.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, the RAIB has made three recommendations, all targeted at DB Schenker, the operator of the train.

'\n  In response to six landslips which occurred on Network Rail infrastructure between June 2012 and February 2013, RAIB has undertaken a class investigation into earthwork issues related to land neighbouring the railway and to risk management during adverse weather. The landslips occurred at Loch Treig (near Tulloch) on 28 June 2012, at Falls of Cruachan (on the line to Oban) on 18 July 2012, at Rosyth (near Edinburgh) on 18 July 2012, at St Bees (Cumbria) on 30 August 2012, at Bargoed (South Wales) on 30 January 2013 and at Hatfield Colliery (South Yorkshire) on 11 February 2013.\n\nThe landslips were caused by factors including heavy rain, absent or ineffective drainage and activities undertaken, or not undertaken, on neighbouring land. In several instances trains were being operated without special precautions when there was a significant risk of encountering a landslip.\n\nMany of Network Rail’s earthworks were constructed with steeper slopes (and therefore a greater likelihood of landslips) than would be achieved with modern design procedures. Network Rail’s on-going earthwork improvement programme is unlikely to achieve modern criteria in the foreseeable future.\n\nNetwork Rail’s process for managing the resulting earthwork risk includes consideration of risk arising outside the railway boundary. RAIB has found that, in some circumstances, key information provided by specialist staff examining earthworks is not considered when the slope management strategy is determined during evaluation. There is a lack of clarity about who should be carrying out visual checks for risks which can develop on neighbouring land between examinations which take place at intervals of up to ten years. The mandated process for collecting information about neighbouring land is, in parts, difficult to implement and not usually followed. Recent technological developments could offer means of improving the collection of this information.\n\nThe location and timing of landslips is difficult to predict but they are almost always triggered by relatively high rainfall. When the landslips described in this report took place, Network Rail’s adverse weather risk management process used forecasts of heavy rainfall to implement special precautions at locations where landslips were considered relatively likely. During the investigation, Network Rail has introduced a new process which also takes account of ground saturation and (in addition to likelihood) the possible consequence of a landslip.\n\nThe RAIB has made five recommendations, addressed to Network Rail, relating to improving management of earthwork and drainage risk arising from neighbouring land; considering all information provided by examiners when undertaking evaluations; and enhancing the new adverse weather risk management process.\n\nR082014-140402-Landslips.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for landslips \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/class_investigation_into_landslips.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 1 August 2015 at about 11:11 hrs, a freight train travelling within a work site collided with the rear of a stationary freight train at 28 mph (45 km/h).\n\nEngineering staff had authorised the driver of the moving freight train to enter the work site at New Cumnock station, travel about 3 miles (4.8 km) to the start of a track renewal site, and bring the train to a stand behind the stationary train.\n\nThere were no injuries but the locomotive and seven wagons from the moving train and eleven wagons from the stationary train were derailed; the locomotive and derailed wagons were damaged. One wagon came to rest across a minor road. There was also substantial damage to the track on both railway lines.\n\nThe immediate cause was that the moving train was travelling too fast to stop short of the rear of the stationary train when its driver first sighted the train ahead. This was due to a combination of the train movement in the work site not taking place at the default speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) or at caution, as required by railway rules, and the driver of the moving train believing that the stationary train was further away than it actually was.\n\nAn underlying cause was that drivers often do not comply with the rules that require movements within a work site to be made at a speed of no greater than 5 mph (8 km/h) or at caution.\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made four recommendations addressed to freight operating companies.\n\nOne relates to the monitoring of drivers when they are driving trains within possessions and work sites.\n\nTwo recommendations relate to implementing a method of formally recording information briefed to drivers about making train movements in possessions and work sites.\n\nA further recommendation relates to investigating the practicalities of driving freight trains in possessions and work sites for long distances at a speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) or at other slow speeds, and taking action to address any identified issues.\n\nRAIB has also identified three learning points including:\n\n\n  the importance of providing drivers with all of the information they need to carry out movements in possessions and work sites safely\n  a reminder to provide drivers (before they start a driving duty) with information about how and when they will be relieved\n  the importance of engineering staff giving instructions to drivers through a face to face conversation when it is safe and practicable to do so.\n\n\nR132016_160713_Logan\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/freight_train_collision_near_logan.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At approximately 19:27 hrs on 19 March 2012, train 6Y33 was approaching Blatchbridge Junction, near Frome in Somerset. The train was made up of a number of engineering vehicles including a track renewal unit (known as a P95 machine). Part of the P95 machine included two control cabs, which were attached to an overhead supporting beam. One of these cabs, weighing around 1.25 tonnes, became detached from the overhead beam and fell to the track below (a distance of around 450 mm).\n\nThe unsecured control cab remained loosely connected to its vehicle by electrical control cables and an air brake hose. These helped to guide the control cab in a relatively straight line as it slid along the top of the rails beneath the train, until the train stopped around 1 ½ miles further on. A foot crossing was damaged as the control cab slid along the rails. The control cab itself was significantly damaged and was rebuilt following the incident.\n\nThe incident occurred because all eight bolts securing the control cab broke. The bolts broke due to a combination of factors, including:\n\n\n  When the P95 machine was in its working mode (moving at less than walking pace) the bolts securing the cab experienced very high stress for very short periods. This cycle of strain events occurred several times each shift and caused fatigue in the bolts.  \n  The fatigue strength of the bolts was reduced by the presence of corrosion on the bolts. The design of the bolt mounting arrangement allowed moisture to reach the bolts.\n  Some of the bolts had broken before the incident and maintenance of the P95 had not identified this because the maintenance instructions were not clear and lacked technical detail.  \n  It is possible that a previous incident adversely affected the fatigue performance of some of the bolts securing the control cab. Other bolts may have been affected by the uneven change in load.  \n  Following the previous incident the bolts were not inspected because it was believed damage to the control cab was only superficial and the maintenance instructions did not indicate that the bolts needed to be removed for inspection following an incident directly affecting the control cab.\n\n\nThe RAIB has made seven recommendations. Four are addressed to Network Rail (three of which require working with AmeyColas, the operator and maintainer of the P95) and three recommendations are addressed to Matisa (UK) Ltd who represent the vehicle manufacturer.\n\nR152013-130912-Blatchbridge-Junction.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nResponse to recommendations for Blatchbridge Junction\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/dangerous_occurrence_at_blatchbridge_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 6 April 2011, an assistant track section manager (ATSM) employed by Network Rail discovered a structure (Bridge 94, on the main line between Birmingham and Gloucester) supporting the track which he believed to be collapsing. He was on site to check a hole in the ballast under sleepers on the down main line, first identified during a routine track inspection eight days previously, which had reappeared despite being filled with clean ballast.\n\nThe ATSM arranged for track maintenance staff to attend site during the evening to monitor the track. They discovered that ballast was falling into a watercourse under each passing train, and reported the failure to Network Rail’s fault control. Staff on site arranged an emergency speed restriction, followed by the diversion of trains onto other lines to bypass the failing structure. There were no injuries, but severe disruption continued until after emergency repairs were complete 36 hours later.\n\nNobody had inspected the part of the structure where the failure occurred since 2001 because neither Railtrack/Network Rail nor their structures examination contractor recognised the need for staff who were trained and equipped to enter a confined space to examine this structure. Consequently the condition of the part of the structure supporting the track was unknown.\n\nRAIB has identified one learning point from this incident: the importance of undertaking reconnaissance visits as an integral part of the planning process for detailed examinations.\n\nRAIB has also made recommendations to Network Rail that focus on improving the awareness of structures which are not easily visible from track level, and improving the structures examination regime.\n\nR052012-120322-Bromsgrove.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bromsgrove\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/partial_failure_of_railway_bridge_94_bromsgrove.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  Following the fatal accident at Halkirk automatic open level crossing, Caithness, on 29 September 2009, RAIB decided to carry out two separate investigations. The first of these was into the Halkirk accident, while the second was to investigate the more general safety issues associated with automatic open level crossings installed on Network Rail’s managed infrastructure. This report addresses the more general safety issues.\n\nRAIB’s investigation confirmed that automatic open level crossings, which are protected only by road traffic light signals, and have no barriers, are the highest risk form of level crossing for vehicle drivers on public roads, and some of them have a significant history of incidents and accidents.\n\nThe investigation found that the lack of barriers at automatic open level crossings is the most significant factor contributing to vehicle drivers passing the road traffic light signals when they are operating, either deliberately or as a genuine error. RAIB considers that the crossings with the highest risk of collision between trains and road vehicles should be upgraded, probably by fitting half barriers, but there may be other means which deliver an equivalent or better level of safety (eg closure).\n\nThe high cost of new level crossings is a reason why it can be difficult to justify upgrading existing crossings based on a cost benefit analysis. However, a system is being developed to retro-fit half barriers to existing automatic open crossings at a much lower cost than that of a new crossing. If this initiative is successful, it will be easier to justify the upgrade of existing crossings. RAIB believes that this work should be prioritised accordingly.\n\nThe safety of level crossings can be improved by taking action against vehicle drivers who deliberately pass the flashing red lights. Where this behaviour is prevalent, red light enforcement equipment is a deterrent. RAIB believes that the development of fixed digital cameras and their installation at selected level crossings, particularly in combination with greater penalties, would be beneficial in improving safety and should be prioritised. \n\nThe identification of factors at each crossing that lead to deliberate risk taking behaviour or genuine errors would enable appropriate risk reduction measures to be implemented. RAIB believes that the existing risk assessments of automatic open level crossings should be reviewed to check whether all the relevant factors have been identified, and to determine whether additional mitigation measures are required.\n\nFinally, RAIB believes that Network Rail’s process covering the risk assessment of level crossings should include guidance to its staff on how to identify the relevant human factors, and take account of the associated risk, at specific level crossings in order to determine the adequacy of existing mitigation measures and the need for additional measures. This builds upon a similar recommendation RAIB made following its investigation of the Halkirk accident.\n\nR122011-110728-AOCLs-Class-Inv.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for AOCL class investigation\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/aocl_class_investigation.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  During the evening of 19 December 2009, a wheelchair user suffered a near-miss with a train on Victory level crossing, near Taunton in Somerset.  One of the front wheels of his wheelchair became embedded in an area of ballast at the edge of the crossing, with part of the wheelchair obstructing the down line.\n\nShortly after this happened, a train approached on the down line and the wheelchair user was forced to pull himself out of the wheelchair, which was subsequently struck by the train.  The wheelchair user suffered minor injuries in the incident.\n\nThe immediate cause was that one of the front wheels of the wheelchair became stuck in an area of ballast in the south-west corner of the crossing.\n\nThe causal factors were: the non-application of asphalt to the full length of the south side of the crossing during the renewal work and that this uneven interface was not identified during a number of crossing inspections and risk assessments; it was dark at the time of the incident, which made it difficult for the wheelchair user to see the area of ballast in the corner of the crossing; and the skewed angle between the railway and the road, meant the wheelchair user was not able to follow a straight path at the side of the level crossing\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail concerning level crossing surfaces, level crossing inspections, minimising the hazards to users of small-wheeled vehicles on level crossings and the management of safety-related work at level crossings.\n\nR182010-101007-Victory.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Victory level crossing \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near-miss_on_victory_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Wednesday 18 January the wagon of a freight train passing through York station ran derailed for approximately 250 metres. There were no injuries sustained as a result of this derailment, however it resulted in damage to the wagon and rail infrastructure.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the collapse of the suspension at one wheel. The suspension collapse occurred because the maintenance regime did not detect the deterioration of a suspension component. There were also two other contributing factors.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of its investigation. All of these are associated with the maintenance of wagons and suspension components.\n\nR212006-060114-York-Station.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for York station\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_york_station.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At around 04:21 hrs on 10 August 2012, an engineering machine used for maintaining track, known as a stoneblower, collided with a stationary engineering machine, at approximately 22 mph (35 km/h), near Arley, in Warwickshire. A member of staff on the stoneblower was treated in hospital for a minor injury. The stoneblower was badly damaged and deemed to be beyond economic repair.\n\nThe investigation found that when the stoneblower driver sighted the stationary machine he was driving too fast to avoid a collision. The driver’s speed was probably influenced by a number of factors which led him to expect that the line was clear. It is also possible that the driver was distracted immediately prior to the collision which caused him to be driving faster than he realised.\n\nIf planned arrangements for the engineering work had been followed the collision would not have occurred.\n\nAn underlying cause of this accident is the tendency of long worksites, in the absence of controls to keep engineering trains (including machines) apart, to increase the risk of collision.\n\nAlthough not a factor in this accident, it is observed that, for driving at night, the 40 mph (64 km/h) maximum speed of travel permitted in engineering worksites is incompatible with the braking and headlight capabilities of the type of engineering machine involved in the collision. The report observes a number of non-compliances with railway industry rules and company procedures during the management of the engineering work. There is also an observation on the difficulties of maintaining the necessary discipline in the driving cab, where mobile telephones are used for communications, to avoid distracting the driver.\n\nThe RAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail. As part of its planned review of the management of engineering work, Network Rail should undertake a fundamental review of the fitness for purpose of the current arrangements and is pointed to a number of areas for potential inclusion in the review. Actions arising from the review should then be implemented. Measures to ensure that train drivers are given all the information they need to make movements safely and to address issues on the use of ntermediaries when conveying information to drivers, are also recommended. In addition, Network Rail is recommended to address a recurrence of specific behavioural issues at its Saltley depot, which the RAIB noted in a previous investigation.\n\nR122013-130808-Arley.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Arley\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_near_arley_warwickshire.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 14:15 hrs on 30 June 2015, a freight train, conveying 22 empty diesel fuel tank wagons, derailed on a track buckle near Langworth, Lincolnshire. The locomotive and the first ten wagons successfully ran over the buckle before the eleventh and the following nine wagons derailed. Four of these wagons overturned and one came to rest across the adjacent track. No-one was injured and there was no diesel fuel spillage. Extensive damage was caused to the train and to the infrastructure. \n\nThe investigation found that the track buckled on the hottest day of the year to date because the forces in the rails resulting from thermal expansion exceeded the ability of the ballast to restrain the track. The buckle started at a point where there was an existing misalignment in the track; a feature which reduced its resistance to buckling. The buckle increased under the train because its permitted speed was too fast for the vulnerable condition of the track and the rail temperature on the day. \n\nUnderlying the accident was a lack of appreciation of the vulnerability of the track to buckling. The under-resourcing of the maintenance team, leading to the continual reprioritisation of maintenance tasks, was also a possible underlying factor. \n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail. The first is to enable improved assessments of the vulnerability of track to buckling on the basis of more accurate data about its ability to withstand thermal expansion. The second is to ensure a more consistent interpretation of risk factors is included in the calculation of rail temperatures at which mitigation measures, such as speed restrictions, should be applied. Two further recommendations relate to local resourcing for track maintenance and managerial oversight of the process of reprioritising or cancelling maintenance tasks. \n\nThe report has also identified two learning points. The first reinforces the importance of completing records of maintenance interventions that could affect the buckling strength of the rail and investigating any anomalous behaviour of the rail during those interventions. The second relates to checking the security of bolts on a type of switch assembly.\n\nR112016_160627_Langworth \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_near_langworth.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 21 August 2006 a fire broke out in the load compartment of a lorry on an HGV shuttle train from the UK to France. The train was brought to a controlled stop 20.5km from the UK portal and all 34 people on board were evacuated without injury. The carrier wagon was structurally damaged, and there was some damage to the overhead line and the tunnel lining. Normal operation of services through the tunnel resumed the next afternoon.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was a fire in the load compartment of a lorry on the penultimate wagon of the HGV shuttle. A contributory factor was the difficulty in detecting a smouldering fire within the lorry’s load compartment. The report also identified several factors relating to the effectiveness of detection and surveillance in the terminal, and the effectiveness of the incident management.\n\nOverall, the incident was well-managed by staff on the train, by the controllers, and by the emergency services. However, RAIB has made sixteen detailed recommendations as a result of this incident.

'\n  At about 11:40 hrs on 28 January 2012, a train struck and fatally injured a pedestrian who was using Johnson’s footpath crossing, in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire.\n\nThe pedestrian started to walk over the crossing as a train was approaching, despite warnings provided by a red miniature stop light and an audible alarm, and crossed into the path of the train. The investigation found that proposals from various bodies to close Johnson’s footpath crossing before 2007 had not been translated into action. In addition, Network Rail had not developed a proposal to install a footbridge to replace the crossing, after an analysis undertaken in 2007 had shown that the benefits of so doing would exceed the costs. Following a further cost-benefit analysis in 2010, a footbridge was in development and has since been installed; Johnson’s footpath crossing was closed on 1 August 2012.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail, one of which requires consultation with RSSB. These relate to an investigation into ways to make cost-effective improvements to the conspicuity of miniature stop light indications, to possible improvements in the visibility of approaching trains at level crossings equipped with miniature stop lights and to a review of options which had previously been identified for reducing risk at level crossings.\n\nR272012-121213-Johnsons.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Johnson’s footpath crossing\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_johnson’s_footpath_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 17:52 hrs on 18 July 2011, a partially detached metal panel on a container train struck the cab of a passing track maintenance vehicle, smashing the side window.\n\nThe driver of the maintenance vehicle subsequently reported seeing a similar panel on the trackside, one mile further on. No-one was injured. The panels, approximately 2.5 m high by 1.0 m wide, were from two modified freight containers, which were fitted with power-generation equipment and were being exported overseas. The panels had covered two ventilation apertures in the container sides. They had been fitted as a temporary measure to help prevent water ingress during the sea voyage.\n\nThe cause of the accident was that screws securing the panels became loose during rail transit. This was initiated by a loss of the clamping force in the bolted joint because of the mechanical properties of a foam seal that was fitted.\n\nThe manufacturer had ensured that the containers were approved in accordance with the International Convention for Safe Containers (the regulatory regime used for assuring the structural safety of freight containers used internationally and transported by surface means). However, neither the convention nor the manufacturer required a structural assessment of this bolted joint.\n\nThe operational safeguards used to prevent unsuitable freight containers being carried on the railway relied on visual examination, and were therefore unable to identify the hidden structural defect.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations to the Heath and Safety Executive. They are concerned with:\n\n\n  making the relevant freight container manufacturers, repairers, modifiers, users and approval bodies aware of the need to assess the structural integrity of such attachments\n  an amendment of the International Convention for Safe Containers.\n\n\nRAIB has also made a recommendation to the train operator regarding its processes for assuring the structural integrity of freight containers that it carries on the railway.\n\nR172012-120809-Althorpe-Park.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Althorpe Park\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_near_althorpe_park.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 14:13 hrs on 7 July 2012, the leading bogie of the 16th wagon of a freight train derailed all wheels to the left as it passed over a set of points at the north end of Shrewsbury station whilst travelling at 14 mph (22 km/h). The bogie ran derailed for 65 metres causing significant track damage in the process before the train was brought to a stop. There were no injuries as a result of the derailment but the wagon suffered damage.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was that the points were unsafe to negotiate because of wear and damage. The degradation of the points since the last detailed inspection had not been prevented by the maintenance regime nor had it been identified by the inspection regime.\n\nThe inspection regime in place at Shrewsbury at the time of the derailment was inconsistent with the risk-based approach intended by Network Rail’s standard aimed at preventing derailment on points. Shrewsbury maintenance delivery unit misinterpreted the intent of this standard, when it was modified in 2008, and ceased regular detailed inspections of the points (this misinterpretation may not have been limited to the Shrewsbury delivery unit). Instead, the inspection regime at Shrewsbury relied solely on a weekly visual inspection by a patroller and a 13-weekly visual inspection by a supervisor. Neither of these inspections triggered the need for a detailed inspection which could have revealed the degradation and the need for remedial actions.\n\nThe RAIB has made four recommendations and identified a learning point. The first recommendation is for Network Rail to ensure that the risk-based approach intended by the standard covering the risk of derailment on points is re-briefed to all delivery units including Shrewsbury. The second recommendation is for Network Rail to incorporate the findings from this investigation into its review of the standard covering the risk of derailment on points. This review started following the accident at Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh in July 2011 and the publication of the RAIB report in August 2012. The third recommendation is for Network Rail to consider whether it needs to mandate the removal of grease and residue on points during the visual inspection by supervisors. The fourth recommendation is for Freightliner to ensure that it has arrangements in place to assess the risk of continued operation when it has identified deficiencies in its maintenance operations.\n\nThe learning point is about the importance of providing training and assessment modules when requiring specific competences in standards covering safety critical activities.\n\nR082013-130722-Shrewsbury.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Shrewsbury \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_of_a_freight_train_at_shrewsbury_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 02:20 hrs on 7 March 2015 an empty 30 ft container became detached from a freight train on the West Coast Main Line at Scout Green, Cumbria. It passed over the adjacent track and came to rest down an embankment. There was no damage to the railway infrastructure or to other trains. A sleeper service had passed the site in the opposite direction about four minutes earlier.\n\nIn a separate incident at around 15:22 hrs on 31 March 2015, an empty 40 ft container was blown from a freight train, near Deeping St Nicholas, Lincolnshire. The container was dragged a short distance by the train, causing extensive damage to the infrastructure, before coming to rest on the adjacent track. There were no passenger services in the area at the time although a freight train had passed the site about five minutes earlier. \n\nThe container detachments were caused by strong gusting winds combined with the speed of the trains, and a defective design of container retention. \n\nThe circumstances of these events were very similar to other container detachments at Hardendale and Cheddington in 2008 which were investigated by the RAIB. That investigation report made a number of recommendations which, had they been implemented, would have prevented these further detachments. This report, therefore, makes no further recommendations. However, three learning points have been identified. These relate to the implementation of the previous recommendations and, where risk is mitigated by procedural measures, to the need for the systematic integration of freight operating companies’ operating procedures with Network Rail’s procedures. \n\nR192015_151207_Scout_Green_DSN \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/container_detachments_cumbria_and_lincolnshire.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 08:03 hrs on 23 March 2015, one bogie of a wagon derailed on a set of points as it crossed between lines at Washwood Heath West Junction, Birmingham. The bogie ran derailed for 121 metres before re-railing itself as it ran through another set of points. The train driver was not aware of the derailment. The signaller noticed irregular indications on his display panel, stopped the train and asked the driver to examine it. The driver found that the tenth wagon in the train showed signs of having run derailed.\n\nThe train comprising a locomotive and 24 container wagons had been travelling at 15 mph (24 km/h) while negotiating the series of crossovers. The wagon that derailed was a container-carrying ‘Megafret’ IKA wagon which consisted of two flat platforms permanently coupled together. The derailment caused significant damage to track and signalling equipment. No-one was injured.\n\nThe track where the wagon derailed was curved and found to contain a twist fault of a magnitude which Network Rail’s track maintenance standard specified should be rectified within 36 hours. Network Rail was not aware of the existence of this fault at the time. \n\nWagons should be capable of negotiating a track twist of a magnitude which the track standard allows to remain in a line open to traffic. When tested, the wagon which derailed was found not to meet the requirements of the relevant Railway Group Standard for resistance to derailment due to track twist.\n\nWhen examined after the derailment, a component on the centre pivot of the bogie, known as a liner, was found to be worn beyond its maintenance limit. The liner is made from a plastic material and allows relative movement between the body and the bogie. The worn liner had restricted the freedom of the bogie to rotate, increasing its rotational stiffness. The worn liner also caused increased wheel unloading on track twists. Both of these factors reduced the wagon’s ability to resist derailment, causing it to derail when it encountered the track twist on the curved track at this location. \n\nThe worn liner had not been identified during maintenance of the wagon as the maintenance instructions were unclear about when it should be inspected. \n\nFollowing another derailment, at Doncaster on 11 April 2015, the wagon owner instigated a check of part of its UK fleet which revealed that a number of other wagons of the same type had experienced a similar degree of centre pivot liner wear.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations and four learning points. Two of the recommendations are made to the wagon owners and cover the maintenance procedures for Megafret wagons and the process for dealing with any problems found with the wagons. One recommendation is made to Network Rail and covers the training and briefing of staff on the maintenance of points of the type used at Washwood Heath West Junction. One of the learning points concerns wagon maintenance and three are related to track maintenance.\n\nR012016_160111_Washwood_Heath \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Washwood Heath West Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_washwood_heath_west_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  Shortly after 08:00 hrs on 8 November 2010, a passenger train running from London Charing Cross to Hastings failed to stop at Stonegate station in East Sussex. The train ran for a further 2.45 miles (3.94 km) with the emergency brake applied, passing the level crossing at Crowhurst Bridge before coming to a stop 3.22 miles (5.18 km) after first applying the brakes.\n\nNo-one was hurt and there was no damage to the train or to the track. The train completed the journey to Hastings after a short delay.\n\nRail adhesion conditions were poor on that day due to high winds causing fresh leaf fall, and the onset of rain. The line had been treated to improve adhesion the previous evening.\n\nIt is likely that the train failed to stop at Stonegate station because there was almost certainly no sand in the sand hoppers at the leading end. If sand had been present, the train braking system would have deposited sand onto the rail head, improving the available adhesion and allowing the train to stop in a much shorter distance.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations to London & South Eastern Railway Ltd, covering improvements in maintenance processes, restrictions on the use of trains that need servicing, driver awareness of low sand conditions and the responsiveness of the sand replenishment regime.\n\nR182011-111117-Stonegate.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Stonegate\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/station_overrun_incident_at_stonegate.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 06:07 hrs on 5 February 2011 a derailment occurred close to Dryclough Junction, in Halifax. Both vehicles of a two-car passenger train were derailed when the train ran into stone rubble on the track. The rubble had fallen from a retaining wall beside the line which had collapsed during the night. There were eight passengers and two crew members on the train and nobody was injured in the accident.\n\nThe collapse of the wall followed a period of heavy rain.\n\nThe local authority highways department had reported cracks in the pavement behind the wall to Network Rail on several occasions, most recently in October 2010, and had closed the footpath as a precaution.\n\nThe investigation found deficiencies in the examination of the wall by Network Rail’s examination contractor and in the way in which Network Rail handled reports from Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council concerning problems with the wall. The limited extent of repairs made to the wall in 2006 also contributed to its failure.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail, relating to the structures examination process, the control of minor civil engineering construction works and the system for dealing with reports from third parties of problems with Network Rail infrastructure.\n\nR172011-111020-Dryclough-Jn.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Dryclough Junction \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_of_a_passenger_train_near_dryclough_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 13:35 hrs on 26 April 2012, a locomotive operated by Devon & Cornwall Railways passed signal SD4-81 at Stafford, which was displaying a red aspect, by about 94 metres.\n\nThe investigation found that the locomotive had been travelling at excessive speed as it approached the Stafford area. The driver was probably aware that he had been exceeding the maximum permitted speed for a locomotive running on its own, but he did not make a full brake application as soon as he saw the signal displaying a double yellow aspect, which was his preliminary warning of the red signal ahead. The driver probably did not have sufficient experience or competence for the task he was performing and Devon & Cornwall Railways had not followed its own process for managing the competence of drivers. The company also had insufficient management controls to ensure compliance with its safety management system.\n\nThe Office of Rail Regulation had not examined the implementation of Devon & Cornwall Railways’ safety management system following the issue of the company’s safety certificate nearly two years before this incident.\n\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations to Devon & Cornwall Railways, covering the competence of safety-critical staff and locomotive maintenance. Two recommendations have been addressed to the Office of Rail Regulation, covering its supervision of a new operator’s safety management system and the effectiveness of Devon & Cornwall Railways’ safety management system. One recommendation has been made to RSSB for the relevant rail industry standard to address the assessment of the training needs of train drivers and other staff transferring between employers.

'\n  At approximately 19:17 hrs on 28 May 2008, train 1K12, travelling from London Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria collided with concrete debris lying on the track beneath a newly constructed bridge generally known as bridge GE19, shortly after it had left Liverpool Street station. This debris had fallen from the bridge following the failure of supports at one end of the bridge deck. This failure caused a sudden jolt which shook the deck, dislodging the concrete planks. Damage to the train was minor and there were no injuries. However, concern over the stability of the bridge resulted in the signaller stopping all other trains in the vicinity. It was some hours before the safety of the structure could be assured, and services did not recommence until the following day.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the concrete planks falling from the partly-completed deck of the bridge onto the track below. This was because of:\n\n\n  the unexpected movement of the bridge deck which was positioned on a steep gradient and inadequately restrained\n  an inadequately planned operation to restore the deck to its correct position. This involved modification to the temporary supports and caused them to become unstable\n  the decision to omit a recommended connection between individual pre-cast concrete planks, which allowed the planks to fall from the deck when it was exposed to a large jolt, and fall onto the track.\n\n\nSince the incident, the bridge has been repaired and completed.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, the RAIB has made seven recommendations, targeted at Network Rail, Health and Safety Executive (Hse), London Underground Limited, Rail for London, the Heritage Rail Association, the Light Rail Engineering Group, Northern Ireland Railways and National Express East Anglia, the operator of the train. These recommendations cover the following areas:\n\n\n  Safety Management Systems and procedures, to satisfactorily approve construction work on or over operational railways\n  procedures so that information is available to operations staff where construction activities might affect the safety of the railway\n  the expansion of the Network Rail’s National Emergency Plan in the light of this incident\n  the wider promulgation of issues identified from this incident amongst the civil engineering community\n  the enhancement of incident management training given to operations staff.\n\n\n \nR222009-090820-GE19.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bridge GE19, London Liverpool Street \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_with_debris_near_london_liverpool_street.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 06:06 hrs on 28 January 2015, the 03:57 hrs freight service from Warrington Arpley yard to Doncaster struck platform supports along the edge of the down platform at Moston station, near Manchester. This displaced other parts of the platform structure which were then struck, at about 06:17 hrs, by the 06:12 hrs passenger service from Manchester Victoria to Leeds. There were no injuries but both trains suffered minor damage.\n\nThe freight train struck the platform structure because spigots intended to secure containers to a wagon, were projecting beyond the permitted width of the wagon. It is not known when the spigots were moved to this position, but closed circuit television (CCTV) evidence indicates that they left Warrington in this condition. The wagon design did not include a physical restraint to prevent the spigots being left in this position, but a member of staff at Warrington Arpley yard was required to check that they were correctly stowed. It is uncertain why this person did not notice the incorrect stowage; possibilities include concentrating on other aspects of his work and the difficulty of distinguishing the wrongly positioned spigots from the similarly coloured side of the wagon.\n\nIt is unlikely that the accident would have occurred if the spacing between Moston Down platform and the adjacent track had met current criteria for new platforms. A high proportion of Network Rail platforms do not meet these criteria and, since 2009, continued use has been permitted where there has been no indication of significant risk. It is possible that historical movements of the platform are at least part of the reason for the tight clearances at Moston, but there has been no significant movement since January 2009. Although not related to the accident, the RAIB observed shortcomings in the Network Rail process for identifying such movements.\n\nThe RAIB investigation has identified one learning point relating to the importance of checking that nothing projects beyond permitted limits before wagons commence journeys.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations. The first, addressed to operators of container wagons, aims to prevent spigots being left in an unsafe position or, if this is not practicable, using paint or alternative means to ensure that incorrectly stowed spigots are easily seen. The second recommendation is addressed to Network Rail and requires that it provides effective processes for identifying platforms at which the distance to the adjacent track is reducing gradually.\n\nR172015_151007_Moston\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Moston station\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/platform_struck_by_trains_at_moston.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 04.53 hrs on Thursday 29 November 2007, a 62 year old track worker, employed by Network Rail, was struck and killed by a glancing blow from an empty passenger train. The track worker was working alone and lifting track protection at the end of overnight maintenance work. The train was operated by First Great Western Trains.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the worker was walking on an open line without keeping an adequate look out for the trains. Causal factors were that he had confirmed that the line was clear to resume operations while he was still some distance from a permanent position of safety. He was also probably using an umbrella in the bad weather, which obscured his view of the approaching train.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made five recommendations, targeted at Network Rail.\n\n\n  Four of the recommendations address wide-ranging issues related to track worker safety\n  The fifth relates to the need for improvements to the monitoring of site visits by managers.\n\n\nSince the accident, Network Rail have undertaken trials aimed at removing the need for on-track protection measures, which in some circumstances, would reduce the requirement for staff to access the track.\n\nR212008-081028-Reading.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Reading\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_near_reading_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  A passenger became trapped in a train door and was pulled along a platform, for a distance of approximately 20 metres, at London King’s Cross station on 10 October 2011. She suffered bruising to the fingers of her left hand.\n\nThe passenger’s hand became trapped when she attempted to board the train while the doors were closing. The train started to move before the passenger’s fingers were released because a member of staff on the platform did not fully check the train doors before signalling that the train could depart. The requirement to check doors is given in the railway Rule Book.\n\nIt is possible that the passenger could have withdrawn her fingers from the doors, before being pulled along the platform, if alternative door edge seals had been fitted on the Class 365 train involved in the incident.\n\nWhen the passenger alarm was operated during the incident, the train did not stop immediately because the driver decided to continue to the next station. This decision had no effect on the incident but was contrary to the railway Rule Book and, in lightly different circumstances, could have increased the severity of the accident.\n\nRAIB has identified two learning points from this accident:\n\n\n  the importance of fully checking train doors before trains depart; and\n  the need for drivers to stop trains immediately if the passenger alarm is operated when any part of the train is within a station.\n\n\nRAIB has also recommended that, the design of door edge seals on Class 365 trains is reviewed, and if appropriate modified, when the seals are renewed as part of a mid-life refurbishment due in 2013.\n\nR092012-120530-King’s-Cross.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for King’s Cross \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/incident_at_king’s_cross_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 16 January 2010, a collision occurred between a passenger train and two cars at the level crossing at Moreton-on-Lugg, near Hereford. The front-seat passenger in one of the cars was fatally injured. The driver was seriously injured and detained in hospital.\n\nThe two occupants of the other car attended hospital as a precaution. There were no casualties on the train, which did not derail.\n\nThe level crossing is controlled from the adjacent signal box. The cause of the accident was that the signaller raised the barriers in error when the train was approaching and too close to be able to stop before reaching the level crossing. He had just been involved in an absorbing telephone call that had interrupted his normal task of monitoring the passage of the train. As a result he believed that the train had already passed over the crossing.\n\nThere was no safeguard in the signalling system to prevent this from happening. There was no plan to fit such a safeguard, and no industry requirement to formally consider the safety benefits of one.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail. They include assessing the need for additional engineered safety measures at level crossings like Moreton-on-Lugg and targeted improvements to its processes for managing risk at level crossings, and for determining when it should bring signalling assets into line with latest safety standards.\n\nR042011v2-110228-Moreton-on-Lugg.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Moreton on Lugg\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_moreton-on-lugg.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At approximately 18:38 hrs on 22 November 2008, an East Midlands Trains passenger train travelling from Worksop to Nottingham struck and fatally injured a woman and her grandson on the crossing.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the pedestrians being unaware of the oncoming train as they crossed in front of it.\n\nSignificant factors in the accident were:\n\n\n  the point at which pedestrians make their decision to cross was not clearly identified\n  there was no appreciation that crossings in darkness present different risks to pedestrians compared within during daylight hours\n  the risk to pedestrians presented by tram operations running parallel to the Network Rail line was not considered by any party.\n\n\nNetwork Rail made changes to the crossing in May 2009, subsequent to the accident, which have improved the visibility of trains for pedestrians, and reduced the time to cross the line. As a result RAIB has made no recommendations about the crossing layout.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made eight new recommendations. Three are directed to Network Rail, two to Network Rail in conjunction with Nottingham Express Transit, two to Network Rail in conjunction with Nottinghamshire County Council, one to Network Rail in conjunction with Nexus (the operator of the Tyne and Wear metro) and one to the Rail Safety and Standards Board.

The derailment caused damage to the track in the vicinity of the points. The position of the two locomotives made re-railing them difficult and it was not accomplished until 06:12 hrs on Tuesday 11 November 2008. The Merehead branch was reopened at 12:40 hrs the same day. No-one was hurt.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the signaller did not operate a set of points to the correct position for the safe movement of train 7A91. Other relevant factors identified include:\n\n\n  a failure affecting signalling equipment on the Merehead branch at the time of the accident\n  the signaller not referring to his route-setting cards when attempting to secure a safe route and the lack of a method over and above the use of route-setting cards for helping signallers working on their own to ensure that they had taken the correct actions in setting the route for trains under signalling equipment failure conditions\n  the number of hours and the nature of the shifts that the signaller at Westbury Power Signal Box had worked in the period leading up to the accident, which meant that he was probably suffering from fatigue\n  the absence of a suitable framework of controls to manage fatigue in safety-critical staff working for Network Rail\n  Network Rail did not have a formal monitoring system in place to identify recurring themes in accident and incident causation (such as fatigue) or the effectiveness of responses to previous relevant recommendations.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made ten recommendations, targeted at Network Rail with a further recommendation targeted at the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). These recommendations cover:\n\n\n  assistance for signallers implementing procedures to address equipment failures while working alone\n  changes to the working arrangements at Westbury Power Signal Box\n  changes to the way Network Rail combats fatigue in its signallers and other safety-critical staff\n  improved processes for Network Rail to review recommendations from accident and incident investigations and identify common themes\n  the Office of Rail Regulation’s monitoring of changes in Network Rail’s approach to fatigue management.\n\n\nR282009-091110-East-Somerset-Junction.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for East Somerset Junction \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_east_somerset_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 13:52 hrs on 24 August 2011, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Gipsy Lane footpath crossing, near Needham Market in Suffolk. The train driver said that he had seen a person on the crossing, on or near to the adjacent line, as the train approached and that when the train’s warning horn was sounded the pedestrian continued to cross and was struck.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to be certain why the pedestrian continued to cross, the RAIB considers that she either did not see the approaching train, she misjudged the speed of the train, or she believed that the train was approaching her on the line she was standing on.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to improving the safety of pedestrians crossing the railway at Gipsy Lane, making sure level crossing data is collected accurately and consistently, developing guidance on short-term mitigation measures at level crossings that have insufficient sighting or warning of trains, and making enhancements to the cost-benefit tool that is used to assess level crossing risk mitigation measures.\n\nR152012-120718-Gipsy-Lane.pdf edit \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Gipsy Lane\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_gipsy_lane_footpath_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 12 September 2006 a South West Trains service from Waterloo to Effingham Junction derailed as it approached Epsom station. One bogie of the fourth carriage derailed while the train was travelling at 17mph. The train came to a stop partly in Epsom station and passengers were able to alight onto the platform. There were no injuries caused by the derailment, but minor damage to the train and track.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was that two wheel flanges climbed the rail head at a set of points. There were five causal factors and one contributory factor relating to the derailment. The underlying causes were a shortage of track maintenance staff in the area, the lack of proper attention to a defective track lubricator, and not understanding the consequences of a lack of lubrication on that section of track.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations as a result of their investigation, aimed at:\n\n\n  resourcing of track maintenance in the Wessex area\n  improving the identification of and response to alignment faults and poor rail condition\n  providing guidance on the use and siting of rail lubricators.\n\n\n \n\nR342007-070913-Epsom.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Epsom\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_epsom.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 00:44 hrs on 26 August 2011, a freight train comprising a diesel-electric locomotive, 30 empty aggregate wagons, and an unloading wagon derailed on the approach to Bordesley Junction, Birmingham. The rear four wagons of the train, which was travelling between Banbury and Barrow-on-Soar, derailed and re-railed during the accident. There was extensive track damage at Bordesley Junction and some damage to the vehicles involved. No one was hurt.\n\nThe immediate cause was that the fourth wagon from the rear derailed when its leading right-hand wheel flange climbed onto the rail head just before the junction. This was because the dynamic load on this wheel was reduced by a combination of factors related to the wagon’s suspension and the track geometry:\n\n\n  The trailing left-hand wheel’s suspension had probably locked-up (ie it had stopped responding to vertical movements) after passing over a track twist. Once locked-up, dynamic load transferred from this wheel and the diagonally opposite leading right-hand wheel to the other wheels, making this wagon more susceptible to derailing on a further track twist. The suspension had locked-up because worn suspension components were not detected during planned maintenance, and no changes had been made to this wagon’s suspension, or to its maintenance regime, after testing had shown this type of suspension was prone to locking-up. An underlying cause was that no organisation took overall ownership of this problem of suspension lock- ups.\n  There were two track twists that had been present for a long time because Network Rail staff carried out repair work in the wrong place. These track twists had formed due to the deteriorating condition of the formation, and although they were identified as repeat faults, no action was taken to investigate why these faults were recurring. Four days before the accident, planned overnight work that would have corrected these faults ran short of time, so the line where the track twists were was not worked on.\n\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations, two directed to Network Rail’s Network Certification Body, one to Lafarge Aggregates Ltd, and one to Network Rail. These cover making improvements to the way the risk of operating privately owned wagons is managed once a fleet wide problem is discovered, carrying out a fundamental review of how the suspension components on these wagons are maintained, implementing modifications to these wagons’ suspensions which reduce the number and duration of lock-ups, and changing the process for briefing staff controlling on- track machine work so information about the priorities for their work is provided.\n\nThere are also two previous RAIB recommendations that were made to Network Rail, which are relevant to this investigation. One calls for measures to improve the accuracy of location information for track geometry faults and the other calls for processes to be put in place for investigating and monitoring the repairs of repetitive track geometry faults.

'\n  RAIB has previously investigated incidents at Oubeck in November 2005, Moy in November 2005 and Kemble on 15 January 2007 where earthworks slope failures resulted in passenger train derailments.\n\nThese incidents were in part caused by a recent period of localised extreme weather, deficiencies in the performance of the local drainage systems at the site and surface water standing on, or flowing from, adjacent non-railway land.\n\nAs a result RAIB decided to investigate Network Rail’s overall process for the management of its earthworks.\n\nThere has been no fatality attributed, either directly or indirectly, to an earthworks failure since 1995. Though the approach to earthworks management taken by Network Rail is comparable or better than other industries with similar type of earthworks, RAIB’s investigations have highlighted some inconsistencies in the application of earthworks management systems across Network Rail.\n\nThe investigation sought to address a number of questions, including: \n\nDoes the available evidence indicate an increasing number of safety related incidents occurring as a result of earthworks failures?\n\nAre the earthworks management systems used by Network Rail appropriately identifying the safety risk?\n\nHow do the processes and systems used by Network Rail compare with those used by the owners of other, similar infrastructure?\n\nIs there any evidence of climate change affecting the behaviour of earthworks and if so how is Network Rail addressing this?\n\nWithin this report RAIB has made four recommendations targeted at Network Rail which relate to work by them to further understand the accuracy and effectiveness of their inspection and assessment processes in mitigating the risk from earthworks failure, improving the consistency of application of good practice seen during this investigation, the provision of guidance to staff in regard to the railways’ neighbours and the alignment of internal procedures which define the actions to be taken in adverse weather.\n\nR252008-081223-Earthworks.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for management of existing earthworks \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/management_of_existing_earthworks.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 12 January 2006 the 02:40 Thameslink service from Bedford to Brighton experienced difficulties when braking for the scheduled stop at Haywards Heath and over-ran the station by approximately 4 vehicle lengths. The train was set back into Haywards Heath and similar braking difficulties were experienced during this move. The train was terminated at Haywards Heath.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the presence of an extraneous washer in the drumswitch, causing an electrical defect preventing the proper application of the brakes. A contributing factor was the difficulty in examining the front section of the drumswitch, where the defect occurred, which may have led to the presence of the washer being missed.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations as a result of its investigation:\n\n\n  First Capital Connect (formerly Thameslink) and Southern to arrange for an inspection mirror to be used when examining the interior of the drumswitch. This recommendation has already been implemented.\n  ALSTOM to review procedures to prevent loose material from interfering with the operation of the drumswitch\n\n\nR102006-060720-HaywardsHeath.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Haywards Heath\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/station_over-run_at_haywards_heath.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  During track renewal work on the East Coast Main Line immediately north of Stevenage on 7 December 2008, the two centre, fast lines were closed to traffic while the outer, slow lines remained open. After darkness had fallen, a track worker, who was standing between the up fast and up slow lines while a rail was being positioned on the up fast line, came into contact with a slow moving train on the up slow line. He sustained severe bruising to his back and damage to his vertebrae.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the trackworker moved out of his position of safety to a point where he came into contact with the train.\n\nThis happened because:\n\n\n  the edge of the zone in which the trackworker was working was not correctly defined\n  the work planning had not identified the hazards and Safe Systems of Work in sufficient detail\n  appropriate protection of staff was not provided\n  the use of rail transposition machinery caused the system of work set up to become unsuitable\n  there was insufficient liaison between staff managing the site\n  the passing train obscured the temporary lighting rendering the work site unlit.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made six recommendations targeted at Jarvis Rail, the main contractor, and Network Rail. These cover:\n\n\n  management systems for planning systems of work, and associated site documentation\n  the assessment and mitigation of risk associated with rail transposing machinery\n  clear communications at work sites\n  the installation of fences next to tracks open to traffic\n  the provision of lighting which can be installed adjacent to lines open to traffic\n  the use of rail transposing plant in close proximity to lines that are open to traffic.\n\n\n \nR232009-090827-Stevenage.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Stevenage\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/trackworker_struck_by_train_stevenage.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 21:45 hrs on 1 November 2014 a pair of rail carrying trolleys, known as ironmen, carrying a 16 metre length of rail, ran out of control for approximately 5.4 miles (8.7 km) along the Garnant Branch line in Carmarthenshire. Two track workers rode on the ironmen as far as Raven level crossing (a distance of about one mile) in order to shout a warning to colleagues who were working there; the warning provided just enough time for their colleagues to get clear of the line. The two track workers received minor injuries when they jumped off the ironmen just before the crossing.\n\nThe track workers were unable to control the speed of the ironmen on the descending gradient towards Raven level crossing. The incident occurred due to a combination of the planning of the work, the control of the work, the speed at which the ironmen were travelling and the performance of the ironmen’s brakes.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations. One recommendation to Network Rail, in conjunction with RSSB and the M&E Engineers Networking Group, to improve the design and testing of the brakes of manually propelled plant. It has made three recommendations to Network Rail relating to the planning of work using manually propelled plant, arrangements for compliance with the requirements of the Rule Book, and measures to mitigate the risk of runaway of manually propelled plant. It has made one recommendation to Permaquip, relating to the design and maintenance of the ironman braking system.

'\n  At 08:34 hrs on 3 September 2007, an empty passenger train derailed on points within the tunnel near to Exhibition Centre station, Glasgow. The points were laid upon a concrete slab base and, following the derailment, the last coach of the train turned on to its side, even though it was travelling at only 12 mph (19km/hr).\n\nRAIB’s investigation found that the points were not fit for the passage of trains due to one of the rails having:\n\n\n  an incorrect shape following earlier remedial grinding\n  no lubrication following the grinding, although this was required by Network Rail’s own standards.\n\n\nThe errors in grinding the switch rails were the result of mis-applying a measuring gauge that Network Rail had recently introduced, and which the operators had been trained to use in a classroom environment, but not on actual track.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB have made four recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail. These cover:\n\n\n  ensuring that hands-on training is given for new tools\n  assessing the risks of installing points on concrete slab bases and researching the effects of derailments on them, (to establish whether the rigidity of the track contributed to the coach overturn)\n  reviewing how Network Rail checks maintenance work on points.\n \n\n\nR042009-090212-Glasgow.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Exhibition Centre \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_near_exhibition_centre_station_glasgow.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 12:28 hours on 4 September 2011, the 11:13 hrs train from London Paddington to Bedwyn went over Ufton level crossing at a speed of 61 mph (98 km/h) while the barriers were in the raised position and the red road traffic signals were not flashing. A car approaching the crossing had to stop suddenly to avoid a collision. Engineering work meant that the equipment which normally operated the crossing automatically had been disabled and the crossing barriers and lights were being operated by an attendant located at the crossing.\n\nThe incident occurred because a signaller did not carry out the rules requiring him to speak with the attendant and the train driver so that the barriers were lowered and the train approached the crossing at low speed. It is probable that these omissions were a result of a lapse and the signaller being overloaded by activities that he was required to undertake in connection with the engineering work and the resumption of passenger services after completion of this work. It is possible that the signaller actions were affected by shortcomings in the presentation of information on the display screens used at his workstation. Inadequate consideration of signallers’ workload associated with engineering work is considered a probable underlying cause.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations addressed to Network Rail. Five directly relate to the incident and cover presentation of information on display screens used by signallers; the introduction of an interface intended to remind signallers to take appropriate precautions when automatic crossings are being controlled by attendants; and consideration of signallers’ workload when planning engineering work. Two recommendations, based on observations made during the investigation, relate to the positioning and removal of the red flags and red lights used by level crossing attendants to stop trains.\n\nR282012-121220-Ufton.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Ufton level crossing\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near_miss_at_ufton_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 31 October 2006 two self-propelled track maintenance machines, a tamper and a ballast regulator, collided near the site of the former station at Badminton, Gloucestershire. The collision occurred on a section of the line that was closed to normal traffic for track renewal work. The tamper was travelling at approx 35mpn and the ballast regulator was stationary. All four members of staff on board the machines were injured, two of them seriously.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the driver of the tamper not controlling his speed or reacting to the presence of the stationary regulator on the line ahead. Causal factors were the fatigue experienced by the driver, and the running of the tamper and regulator separately, rather than coupling them together. Contributory factors were the custom of maintenance machines being driven at more than 20mph in work sites, and the lack of a defined speed limit for these movements.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\n\n\n  keeping work sites as short as possible\n  detecting and dealing with incidents of overspeeding\n  operating on-track machines in tandem/multiple within possessions and work sites where practicable\n  the safety of internal fittings of track maintenance machines.\n\n\nR302007-070822-Badminton.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Badminton\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_badminton.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 20:15 hrs on 15 October 2013, a freight train operated by Direct Rail Services, which was carrying containers, derailed about 4 miles (6.4 km) south west of Gloucester station on the railway line from Newport via Lydney. It was travelling at 69 mph (111 km/h) when the rear wheelset of the last wagon in the train derailed on track with regularly spaced dips in both rails, a phenomenon known as cyclic top. The train continued to Gloucester station where it was stopped by the signaller, who had become aware of a possible problem with the train through damage to the signalling system. By the time the train stopped, the rear wagon was severely damaged, the empty container it was carrying had fallen off, and there was damage to four miles of track, signalling cables, four level crossings and two bridges.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was a cyclic top track defect which caused a wagon that was susceptible to this type of track defect to derail. The dips in the track had formed due to water flowing underneath the track and although the local Network Rail track maintenance team had identified the cyclic top track defect, the repairs it carried out were ineffective. The severity of the dips required immediate action by Network Rail, including the imposition of a speed restriction for the trains passing over it, but no such restriction had been put in place. Speed restrictions had repeatedly been imposed since December 2011 but were removed each time repair work was completed; on each occasion, such work subsequently proved to be ineffective.\n\nThe type of wagon that derailed was found to be susceptible to wheel unloading when responding to these dips in the track, especially when loaded with the type of empty container it was carrying. This susceptibility was not identified when the wagon was tested or approved for use on Network Rail’s infrastructure.\n\nRAIB also observes: the local Network Rail track maintenance team had a shortfall in its manpower resources; and design guidance for the distance between the wheelsets on two-axle wagons could also be applied to the distance between the centres of the bogies on bogie wagons.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations. Four are directed to Network Rail and cover reviewing the drainage in the area where the train derailed, revising processes for managing emergency speed restrictions for cyclic top track defects, providing track maintenance staff with a way of measuring cyclic top after completing repairs, and investigating how cyclic top on steel sleeper track can be effectively repaired. Two are directed to RSSB and cover reviewing how a vehicle’s response to cyclic top is assessed and amending guidance on the design of freight wagons. One is directed to Direct Rail Services and covers mitigating the susceptibility of this type of wagon to cyclic top.\n\nR202014-141009-Gloucester.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Gloucester\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/freight_train_derailment_near_gloucester.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 15:16 hrs on 31 March 2008, a train travelling from Dundee to Bournemouth struck and fatally injured a pedestrian at Tackley Station level crossing in Oxfordshire. The pedestrian was using the crossing - which is also a bridleway - to reach the south-bound platform with the intention of catching a local train to Oxford.\n\nThe train was travelling at 90 mph / 145 kph and sounded its horn on the approach to the crossing.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was the pedestrian stepping onto the crossing and into the path of the train.\n\nPossible causal factors were the pedestrian mistaking a fast train for the stopping service which was due at about the same time, or being unaware of the train’s approach due to an obstruction created by a poorly sited fence.\n\nA contributory factor related to the way in which crossing inspections were undertaken which meant that the need to improve visibility for crossing users was not recognised.\n\nAs a consequence of the accident, RAIB has made six recommendations targeted at Network Rail, as the owner of the crossing and infrastructure manager.

'\n  On Tuesday 18 October 2005 an empty locomotive-hauled freight train was travelling between Bescot and Margam when the wheels of one of its wagons became derailed near Hatherley, just south of Cheltenham Spa station.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the interaction between false flanges which developed on one wagon and a set of points, as a result of the handbrake not being released before departure from Bescot Yard.

'\n  On Friday 07 April, the 16:22 train from Willesden Track Maintenance Depot to Camden Road passed a signal at danger by one coach length near Camden Road station. The train was accelerating under power and could not be switched off by normal use of the controls. No other trains were involved and there were no injuries.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the train was returned to service with incorrectly connected wiring. This was because specified testing was not carried out after a wiring connection was altered during repairs. Contributing factors were the poor condition of cable identification numbers; the lack of a formal procedure for identifying cables when disconnected; the lack of a mandated test sequence; the testing staff’s limited understanding of Class 313 systems; and the design of the traction control circuits.\n\nRAIB has made nine recommendations.

'\n  On 22 December 2009, a freight train travelling south on the West Coast Main Line, in freezing temperatures and snowy conditions, passed two red signals in succession at Carstairs. After it started braking, the freight train took almost two and a half miles to stop. It finally came to a stand over Carstairs Station junction, shortly after the passage of a passenger train. Actions taken by the signaller stopped the freight train from travelling towards a second passenger train that was also approaching Carstairs. Nobody was injured and there was no damage to trains or infrastructure. However, under slightly different circumstances, the incident may have led to either a collision between trains or a derailment.\n\nThe freight train’s braking performance was very poor for a train of its type and was caused by snow and ice ingress stopping the brake equipment on its wagons from working properly. A combination of factors led to this situation occurring:\n\n\n  the way that the driver applied the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions\n  the speed of the train, and as a result the amount of lying snow that it then disturbed\n  the train entering into service with snow and ice already on its brake equipment.\n\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations. Two of the recommendations made are to freight operating companies in conjunction with the Rail Safety & Standards Board (RSSB) and relate to changes to the rules for operating trains in snowy conditions.

'\n  At about 05:50 hrs, a train struck a wooden sleeper lying across the track just after passing through Somerleyton station, while travelling at about 35 mph (56 km/h). At the time the driver did not know what his train had struck but brought the train to a stand. \n\nAfter contacting the signaller and being given permission to go onto the tracks to examine his train, the driver left the cab and found a wooden sleeper wedged underneath the front. The driver, who was accompanied by a second driver, removed the sleeper and found another two sleepers nearby; one lying in the middle of the track under the train and one lying close to the track a short distance behind the train. There were no injuries and there was only minor damage to the train.\n\nDuring Engineering work the night before, bundles of scrap wooden sleepers had been collected from alongside the railway between Somerleyton and Oulton Broad North using a road/rail vehicle with front and rear trailers. Three sleepers fell onto the railway and the staff undertaking this work were not aware of this when they handed the railway back so that trains could start running again.\n\nRAIB has identified two learning points. The first is for Network Rail to remind its staff who plan work involving the lifting and transporting of loads on trailers, that control measures should be specified in the authorised work plan. \nThe second reinforces the need for the Rule Book (GE/RT8000) to be reviewed with the objective of clarifying the responsibilities for ensuring the safety of the line at the conclusion of engineering work.

'\n  At around 13:10 hrs on 25 July 2015, a passenger was dragged along the platform at Hayes & Harlington station, London, when the 11:37 hrs First Great Western service from Oxford to London Paddington departed while her hand was trapped in a door. The passenger, who had arrived on the platform as the doors were about to close, had placed her hand between the closing door leaves.\n\nThe train driver did not identify that the passenger was trapped and the train moved off, dragging the passenger along the platform. After being dragged for about 19 metres, the passenger lost her footing and fell onto the platform. The passenger suffered head, hand and back injuries. \n\nRAIB’s investigation found that the passenger had deliberately placed her hand in the closing door in the expectation that it would re-open as a consequence. RAIB has concluded that after closing the doors of the train, the driver either did not make a final check that it was safe to depart, or that the check was insufficiently detailed to allow him to identify the trapped passenger. The driver may have been misled into thinking that it was safe to depart because a door interlock light in his cab had illuminated, indicating that the doors were closed and locked and he was able to take power. \n\nOur investigation identified that the train driver and other railway staff held the same misunderstanding: if someone had a hand trapped in a door it would not be possible for the door interlock light to illuminate and a driver to take power. This is not the case, and the door was found to be compliant with all applicable standards after the accident.\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made two recommendations. \n\nThe first, addressed to RSSB to review, and if necessary extend, its research into the passenger/train interface to understand passenger behaviour and identify means for deterring members of the public from obstructing train doors. \n\nThe second recommendation is addressed to operators and owners of trains similar to the one involved in the accident at Hayes & Harlington, is intended to continue and expand upon a current review into the practicability of fitting sensitive door edge technology to this type of train. \n\nRAIB has also identified three learning points. The first concerns improving awareness among train drivers of the limitations of train door interlocking technology and the importance of the final safety check when dispatching a train. \n\nThe second concerns the potential for drivers to be distracted by the use of mobile communication devices while driving. \n\nThe third is aimed at train operators to have the necessary processes in place to identify drivers who are showing signs of sub-standard performance or not engaging positively with measures agreed as part of a Competence Development Plan and the provision of briefing and guidance material for driver managers to enable them to identify behaviours and attitudes which are inconsistent with those expected of train drivers.\n\nR122016_160630_Hayes_and_Harlington \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/passenger_accident_at_hayes_&_harlington_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 06:00 hrs on 8 March 2011, two gangs of Network Rail track maintenance staff were involved in incidents with trains between Clapham Junction and Earlsfield stations.

The work was being carried out following the late handback of an engineering possession. There were no casualties, and only minor disruption to train services following the incidents.\n\nThe staff involved did not follow the rules for setting up safe and appropriate systems of work. This was due to a combination of factors including excessive workload, the pressure to complete the work, fatigue and / or tiredness, the complexity of the rules, the absence of checking of the arrangements by a third party, the ineffectiveness of Network Rail’s competence management process and a shortage of staff.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to the arrangements for carrying out unplanned and / or emergency work, the pressure on those responsible for setting up protection arrangements for access to the railway in such situations, the workload of Track Section Managers, the competence of staff in situations which are encountered infrequently and the provision of confirmation to the signaller that an emergency speed restriction has been set up.\n\nR032012-120227-Clapham&Earlsfield.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Clapham & Earlsfield\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/track_worker_incidents_clapham_junction_and_earlsfield.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 23 September 2009, at approximately 18:35 hrs, shortly after the arrival of the 17:13 hrs train from Paris Nord at platform 9 of St Pancras International station, London, the overhead wire supplying electric power to the train, which was live at 25kV, parted and fell to the ground.  This occurred during the preparation of the train for its next journey, while many passengers who had left the train were walking along the platform. \n\nThe immediate cause was the parting of the overhead wire because of local overheating caused by the high electric current flowing from the wire to one of the train’s pantographs.\n\nThe causal factor was an incorrect distance between the points of the electrodes on the lightning arrester caused a flashover.\n\nThe probable causal factors were: incorrect connection of cables in the circuit detecting the flow of excessive current to the OHLE; the absence of continuity testing during commissioning of the supply system protection equipment; the margin between the specified performance of the protection equipment and OHLE, and the conditions that caused the OHLE to fail was small.  Had the specification provided a greater margin, it is more likely that the OHLE would have survived intact. \n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations concerning: the design and/or maintenance of the lightning arrestor; review of quality management processes relating to the installation, testing and commissioning of safety related railway equipment; the possibility of reducing the risk associated with damaged OHLE of the tramway type falling onto station platforms; the review, and if appropriate amendment, of the requirements for the performance of electrification systems being brought into use; investigating an effective means of reminding the controller of the correct procedure to be followed before closing a circuit breaker; reviewing the induction procedures for new shift managers so that they are made aware of the procedures to be followed by electrical controllers following an automatic trip; and making permanent the temporary instruction to electrical controllers that staff at St Pancras are to be contacted to confirm that all persons are in positions of safety before attempting to reclose a circuit breaker that has opened automatically.\n\n \nR122010-100805-StPancras.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for St Pancras International \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/overhead_line_failure_at_st_pancras_international.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 14:00 hrs on 13 November 2007 a track worker engaged in a planned track inspection was struck by a passing train on Grosvenor Bridge south of London Victoria station. He suffered serious injuries.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the track worker moved away from a line under lookout protection and toward an adjacent line on which a train was approaching. Causal factors were the position where the track worker was walking relative to the lookout, and him not informing the lookout of his intention to move to the other line.\n\nRAIB identified other factors that may have caused or contributed to the accident, including:\n\n\n  the relationships in the group of staff involved\n  the sounding and reaction to the train horn\n  the close proximity of bridge girders that restricted access.\n\n\nUnderlying issues concerned the workload of the local track managers, and the documentation of track inspections.\n\nRAIB has also made five observations about related matters that did not directly contribute to the accident.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made nine recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail. These cover the following areas:\n\n\n  the responsibility of individuals to ensure that they receive adequate safety briefings\n  the provision of automatic warning systems\n  the use of safety helmets during track inspection\n  the effectiveness of processes for confirming ‘on-the-job’ safety performance\n  instruction on safe systems of work when trains move on adjacent lines\n  documentation for track inspectors\n  rebriefing of staff about limited clearance hazards.\n\n\nR192009-090716-Grosvenor-Bridge.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Grosvenor Bridge\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_grosvenor_bridge.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 12:15 hrs on 2 April 2014, two wagons of a nominally empty freight train derailed on the approach to Angerstein Junction, near Charlton in south east London. The derailed wagons were pulled over the junction and stopped on the Blackheath to Charlton line, with the two wagons partly obstructing the line used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. No other trains were involved in the accident and no-one was injured, but there was significant damage to the railway infrastructure.\n\nThe wagons derailed because the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient load to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track. The insufficient load was due to a combination of a track defect, an unevenly distributed residual load in the wagon, and an uneven distribution of load associated with a twisted bogie. The unevenly distributed residual load comprised finely crushed rock which adhered to the side of wagon, and was not discharged by unloading procedures. These procedures had been developed without recognising the derailment risk associated with carrying relatively small, but significantly unbalanced, loads. This combination of factors illustrates the derailment risk which arises when wagons carrying one or more defects are operated on track with one or more defects in circumstances where both wagon and track are compliant with relevant railway standards (ie the defects on wagon and track are not, individually, sufficient to prevent train operations continuing).\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations, several of which could be informed by work undertaken as part of a cross-industry programme already initiated by the ORR after previous RAIB investigations identified derailment risks associated with operation of wagons and track which are imperfect, but nevertheless compliant with relevant standards. \nOne recommendation addressed to Aggregate Industries seeks improved wagon load discharge arrangements. Two recommendations addressed to RSSB are intended to mitigate risks associated with imperfect wagons, carrying unevenly distributed loads, on imperfect track. Three recommendations, addressed to Network Rail, seek appropriate control of derailment risk in sidings where derailed vehicles can affect running lines, provision to wagon operators of wagon defect information collected by trackside equipment, and possible modifications to the method of collecting track twist data in order to reflect the effect of this track defect on modern rolling stock.\n\nR112015_150812_Angerstein_Junction\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Angerstein Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_angerstein_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At approximately 14:24 hrs on 23 March 2011, train number 1M68, the 13:45 hrs service from Cardiff to Nottingham, passed over Lydney manually controlled barrier (MCB) level crossing while the barriers were in the raised position. This crossing is on the main line between Gloucester and Newport. The railway signal protecting the level crossing was showing green, and the train was travelling at 59 mph (94 km/h). The red flashing lights intended to instruct road users to stop were operating and there were no road vehicles on the crossing. No injuries or damage resulted from the incident.\n\nThe crossing keeper had raised the up side barrier manually during the 90 minutes before the incident, due to a defect in the equipment controlling the barrier motors. Shortly before the incident, the crossing keeper lowered the barriers for a train approaching from the direction of Gloucester. He then raised both barriers manually just before the Cardiff to Nottingham train arrived at the crossing. An annunciator (buzzer) intended to warn the crossing keeper about approaching trains did not give the usual warning.\n\nThe railway signals protecting Lydney crossing should have been placed at danger before the barriers could be raised safely. The crossing keeper had no facility to control these signals, and did not inform signallers at Newport who could have kept the signals at danger while the barriers were raised. Several possible reasons for not informing the signaller have been identified.\n\nRAIB has made recommendations to Network Rail relating to the adequacy of instructions and training given to crossing keepers and signallers; and, the process used for on-going assessment of staff competencies. RAIB has also recommended that Network Rail should modify standards for new and upgraded crossings so that protecting signals always display a stop aspect when the crossing barriers are raised.\n\nR202011-111215-Lydney.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Lydney\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/train_passing_over_lydney_level_crossing_with_the_barriers_raised.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 23:42 hrs on 28 January 2011, a passenger alighting from the last coach of a train at Brentwood station fell, head first, between the side of the train and the platform. Another passenger who had alighted from the same train saw her begin to fall and was able to hold on to one of her legs. The driver of the train did not see this happen and the train departed from the station with the passenger still in the gap between the train and the platform. The passenger sustained injuries to her leg and head in the accident.\n\nAt Brentwood station train drivers are required to undertake a safety check after closing the train’s doors and before moving out of the platform. To do this, the driver needs to look out of his cab window at the first six coaches of the train and look at a platform-mounted monitor to see the last two coaches of the train.\n\nThe driver of the train involved in the accident had stopped beyond the monitor and in a position where it was only just possible to see the image. He performed the safety check as the train started to move and it is therefore unlikely that he was able to see the events happening at the last coach of the train before the image in the monitor was obscured. It is also possible that his view of the last coach was obstructed by a passenger walking along the platform.\n\nThe investigation found that the passenger had tried to alight as the doors started to close and then fell as she squeezed between the leaves of the door. The investigation also identified weaknesses in the way that the train operator, National Express East Anglia, had trained, briefed and monitored its drivers who are required to dispatch trains from unstaffed platforms and in the way that it addressed the risk from driver-only operation of trains. There were also weaknesses in the way that key items of equipment (monitors and signage provided to indicate to a train driver where to stop) were configured on the platform where the accident occurred.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations:\n\n\n  three to National Express East Anglia relating to driver training and assessment, risk assessment reviews and the availability of CCTV equipment on trains\n  one to Network Rail relating to working with train operators to assess periodically the suitability of equipment provided at unstaffed platforms to assist train drivers to dispatch trains\n  one to the Rail Safety and Standards Board relating to the inclusion within industry guidance of a clause on observing train doors while they are closing by all staff involved in train dispatch, so far as is reasonably practicable.\n\n\nR192011-111128-Brentwood.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Brentwood \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/passenger_accident_at_brentwood_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 25 September 2006 a Virgin train service from Plymouth to Edinburgh was travelling at approximately 100 mph when it struck a car on the site of a former level crossing at Copmanthorpe, south of York. The car driver was fatally injured in the collision. Although three axles of the train derailed, the train remained upright and there were no injuries on board.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the car entering onto the railway through a fenced boundary. It has not been possible to establish why the car carried on past the end of the road and onto the railway. A possible contributing factor was the lack of a risk assessment into vehicle incursion on to the railway at that point.\n\nRAIB has made no recommendations in relation to the cause of the accident.

'\n  The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has investigated a number of accidents involving track workers on Network Rail’s infrastructure and has identified track worker safety as an area of particular concern in recent annual reports.\n\nRAIB has also become concerned at the number of operating irregularities associated with the protection of those carrying out engineering work, particularly where protection was planned to block the line to traffic. This is because, in different circumstances, these irregularities could have led to harmful, and possibly fatal, outcomes.\n\nRAIB observed the regular occurrence of these operating irregularities in the daily incident reports \nproduced by Network Rail’s National Operations Centre. As a result, it decided to collect information over a two-year period (April 2011 to April 2013) to understand more. This report describes analysis that the RAIB has carried out based on this information, and its investigation of the safety issues that this identified.\n\nThe data analysis showed that most of the reported operating irregularities were potentially harmful and that their occurrence was neither infrequent nor reducing. A systematic review of these was then undertaken to identify the various safety issues that would need to be addressed to prevent them occurring and leading to harm.\n\nRAIB is aware that Network Rail is currently planning and implementing a major track safety initiative known as ‘Planning and Delivering Safe Work’ (PDSW). The investigation has sought to understand this and has established that Network Rail intends that PDSW will address a number of the safety issues identified.\n\nHowever, RAIB has observed that the initiative is currently only in the early stages of implementation and that the envisaged benefits have yet to be demonstrated. It has also observed that the initiative is intentionally focused on the roles of those working on site. This means that it will not have significant benefits in areas where risks may be created by people in a number of other roles that are important in safeguarding those carrying out work on the railway.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations addressed to Network Rail. They are concerned with:\n\n\n  monitoring and verifying the benefits obtained from the PDSW initiative\n  developing an action plan to reduce the risks associated with railway roles that are outside the scope of the PDSW initiative.\n\n\nR142015_150820_Protection_irregularities\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for possession irregularities\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/class_investigation_–_protection_irregularities.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 02:30 hrs on 2 October 2014, a loaded coal train derailed at Porthkerry, between Barry and Rhoose on the Vale of Glamorgan line in South Wales. The last two wagons in the train were derailed when the rail beneath them collapsed. Nobody was injured.\n\nThe cause of the derailment was the failure of a section of the left-hand rail due to a metallurgical defect within that rail. The defect arose due to impurities within the steel which had been present since manufacture. The rail had been installed at Porthkerry in 2008 but had previously been used at another site. The presence of the defect was not discovered when the rail was installed at Porthkerry.\n\nThe rail was not replaced before it collapsed due to a combination of factors: visual inspections intended to identify this type of defect had not been carried out, the regular track inspections had not found it and none of the staff responsible for management of the track had identified that the rail needed urgent replacement.\n\nThe defect that was later to cause the derailment was eventually discovered on 30 July 2014 during an inspection that was being carried out to monitor a different type of rail defect. However, according to Network Rail’s standards, a defect of the type identified did not require urgent attention and therefore a period of 52 weeks was allowed for rail replacement. Consequently no action was taken to address the reported defect before the date of the derailment.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail concerning the methods used to detect this type of rail defect, the techniques used to assess its severity and assessing the risk posed by similar rail in other locations.\n\nRAIB has also identified a learning point for the industry concerning the delegation of inspections by track maintenance engineers.\n\nR102015_150806_Porthkerry\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Porthkerry\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_porthkerry.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 03:00 hrs on 21 April 2013, a road rail vehicle (RRV) ran away as it was being on-tracked north of Glasgow Queen Street High Level Tunnel on a section of railway sloping towards the tunnel. The RRV ran through the tunnel and struck two scaffolds that were being used for maintenance work on the tunnel walls. A person working on one of the scaffolds was thrown to the ground and suffered severe injuries to his shoulder. The track levelled out as the RRV ran into Glasgow Queen Street station and, after travelling a total distance of about 1.1 miles (1.8 kilometres), it stopped in platform 5, about 20 metres short of the buffer stop.\n\nThe RRV was a mobile elevating work platform that was manufactured for use on road wheels and then converted by Rexquote Ltd to permit use on the railway. The RRV’s road wheels were intended to provide braking in both road and rail modes. This was achieved in rail mode by holding the road wheels against a hub extending from the rail wheels. The design of the RRV meant that during a transition phase in the on-tracking procedure, the road wheel brakes were ineffective because the RRV was supported on the rail wheels but the road wheels were not yet touching the hubs. Although instructed to follow a procedure which prevented this occurring simultaneously at both ends of the RRV, the machine operator unintentionally put the RRV into this condition. He was (correctly) standing beside the RRV when it started to move, and the control equipment was pulled from his hand before he could stop the vehicle.\n\nThe RRV was fitted with holding brakes acting directly on both rail wheels at one end of the vehicle. These were intended to prevent a runaway if non-compliance with the operating instructions meant that all road wheel brakes were ineffective. The holding brake was insufficient to prevent the runaway due to shortcomings in Rexquote’s design, factory testing and specification of maintenance activities. The lack of an effective quality assurance system at Rexquote was an underlying factor. The design of the holding brake was not reviewed when the RRV was subject to the rail industry vehicle approval process because provision of such a brake was not required by Railway Industry Standards.\n\nRAIB has identified one learning point which reminds the rail industry that the rail vehicle approval process does not cover all aspects of rail vehicle performance. \n\nRAIB has made four recommendations. One requires Rexquote to implement an effective quality assurance system and another, supporting an activity already proposed by Network Rail, seeks to widen the scope of safety-related audits applied by Network Rail to organisations supplying rail plant for use on its infrastructure. A third recommendation seeks improvements to the testing process for parking brakes provided on RRVs. The final recommendation, based on an observation, relates to the provision of lighting on RRVs.\n\nR152014-140717-Glasgow-Queen-Street.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Queen Street Tunnel\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/runaway_of_a_road_rail_vehicle_and_collision_in_queen_street_high_level_tunnel.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  Shortly before 22:00 hrs on 19 June 2011 a passenger train, travelling from Aberystwyth to Machynlleth, ran onto the level crossing at Llanbadarn while the barriers at the crossing were raised, and came to a stop with the front of the train about 31 metres beyond the crossing. There were no road vehicles or pedestrians on the crossing at the time.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the train driver did not notice that the indicator close to the crossing was flashing red until it was too late for him to stop the train before it reached the crossing. Factors behind this included the driver’s ‘workload’ (his need to observe a screen in the cab at the same time as he should also be observing a lineside indicator), the design of the equipment associated with the operation of the level crossing, and the re-setting of the signalling system on board the train before it could depart from Aberystwyth. An underlying cause of the incident was that the signalling system now in use on the lines from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth and Pwllheli does not interface with the automatic level crossings on these routes.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations, three directed to Network Rail, two to Arriva Trains Wales and one to the Rail Safety and Standards Board. These cover the development of engineering solutions to mitigate the risk of trains passing over automatic crossings which have not operated correctly; changes to the operating equipment of Llanbadarn crossing; the processes used by railway operators to request permission to deviate from published standards; the operational requirements of drivers as trains depart from Aberystwyth; and the way in which drivers interact with the information screens of the cab signalling used on the Cambrian lines.\n\nR112012-120627-Llanbadarn.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Llanbadarn\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/incident_at_llanbadarn_automatic_barrier_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 07:38 hrs on 22 March 2012, a motorist used the telephone at Lindridge Farm user worked crossing, near Bagworth in Leicestershire, to ask the signaller at Network Rail’s East Midlands Control Centre for authorisation to cross the railway. The signaller checked the indications on his workstation, observed that a train had already passed over the crossing, and gave permission to cross. The motorist opened the near gate, crossed the railway line on foot, and while opening the far gate saw a train approaching. The motorist called the signaller back to report what had happened.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the signaller believed the train had already passed the level crossing when he gave the motorist permission to cross because his workstation view showed the level crossing in the wrong place. This error had been present on the workstation view from the time it was commissioned on 3 January 2012 as part of a project to transfer control of the railway from Leicester signal box to the East Midlands Control Centre.\n\nThis project had redrawn a signalling plan for the Leicester area and introduced an error; a track circuit was incorrectly named. This error was not noticed and was copied into a scheme plan, which was subsequently used to check the design of the signaller’s workstation views. During these design checks, the level crossing was moved to the wrong track section on the view, so that it corresponded with the error on the scheme plan. The error on the view was not identified during testing so the signaller’s workstation was commissioned with the level crossing shown in the wrong place.\n\nRAIB also observes: the signaller did not report the incident straight away; the workstation had been commissioned with two other user worked crossings shown in the wrong place; and the other two level crossings had also previously been shown in the wrong place on the signaller’s panel at Leicester signal box prior to the transfer of control to the EMCC.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations, all directed at Network Rail. These cover the management of signalling source records needed for a re-control project, ways of reducing the likelihood of errors on signalling or scheme plans, correlating new signalling displays to the existing display, improving the management of deferred test logs, and better controls for installing telephones at level crossings. RAIB also identified a learning point for the railway industry, about the importance of immediately reporting allegations of incidents that are received from members of the public.\n\nR112013-130729-Lindridge-Farm.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Lindridge Farm UWC\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/dangerous_occurrence_at_lindridge_farm_user_worked_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 13:42 hrs on 28 January 2012 a wagon on a container train derailed, and then re-railed, when crossing a section of track connecting two lines (a crossover) at Reading West Junction. No-one was injured. However, the condition of the train was such that the derailment could have taken place elsewhere, in which case the consequences might have been more severe.\n\nThe train was formed of 25 container-carrying flat wagons. The wagon that derailed was the 24th from the front. It was carrying a single freight container on the trailing end, which was packed with 13 pallets of automotive components, each weighing approximately 1300 kg. On opening the container, the RAIB found that all the pallets were unsecured and had moved to the side, resulting in uneven loading of the wagon. A survey of the track revealed a geometry defect (a twist fault) close to the point of derailment.\n\nThe cause of the derailment was that there was insufficient load on the front right-hand wheel of the wagon to prevent its flange climbing over the railhead. This was the combined result of the uneven loading on the wagon, specifically the lateral offset of the payload in the container, and the effect of the twist fault on the crossover.\n\nThe RAIB concluded that the pallets had moved during the road journey to the freight terminal where the container was loaded onto the train. Schaeffler Automotive, the company that packed the container, had no processes at the time to ensure that the pallets would not move. The checks and handling methods used by Freightliner, the operator of the terminal, did not detect the offset load.\n\nAlthough the size of the twist fault did not require the line to be blocked to traffic, Network Rail’s processes for track inspection and maintenance had not identified that it existed.\n\nThe RAIB has made five recommendations, one directed to the Health and Safety Executive, two to Freightliner and two to Network Rail. They are concerned with:\n\n\n  making relevant parties aware of the need to pack freight containers in accordance with published guidance, and gaining assurance that this is being done;\n  the detection of at-risk freight containers and wagons before they enter traffic;\n  the detection of track geometry defects after mechanised maintenance; and\n  minimising the formation of track geometry defects during mechanised maintenance.\n\n\n R022013-130128-Reading-West.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Reading West Junction\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/freight_train_derailment_at_reading_west_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 17:31 hrs on 22 February 2015, a high speed passenger train (HST), the 16:34 hrs First Great Western service from London Paddington to Penzance, struck and ran over part of the fallen masonry parapet of an overline bridge at Froxfield, Wiltshire. \n\nThe train was fully loaded with around 750 passengers and was travelling at a speed of 86 mph (138 km/h) when the driver saw the obstruction. He applied the emergency brake but there was insufficient distance to reduce the speed significantly before the train struck the parapet. The train did not derail and came to a stop around 720 metres beyond the bridge. There were no injuries. The leading power car sustained damage to its leading bogie, braking system, running gear and underframe equipment. \n\nThe immediate cause of the collision was that the eastern parapet of Oak Hill Road overline bridge had been pushed off and onto the tracks, by a heavy goods vehicle which had reversed into it. The train had not been stopped before it collided with the debris because of delays in informing the railway about the obstruction on the tracks.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations relating to the following:\n\n\n  installation of identification plates on all overline bridges with a carriageway unless the consequence of a parapet falling onto the tracks or a road vehicle incursion at a particular bridge are assessed as likely to be minor\n  enhancing current road vehicle incursion assessment procedures to include consideration of the risk from large road vehicles knocking over parapets of overline bridges (two recommendations)\n  introduction of a specific requirement in a Railway Group Standard relating to the onward movement of a train that is damaged in an incident, so that the circumstances of the incident and the limitations of any on-site damage assessment are fully considered when deciding a suitable speed restriction, especially when there are passengers on board.\n\n\nRAIB has also identified two learning points, one for police forces regarding the importance of contacting the appropriate railway control centre immediately when the safety of the line is affected and the other for road vehicle standards bodies and the road haulage industry about the benefits of having reversing cameras or sensors fitted to heavy goods vehicles. \n\nR022016_160120_Froxfield \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Froxfield\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_between_a_train_and_a_fallen_bridge_parapet_at_froxfield.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 19:25 hrs on 4 January 2010, a passenger train from Barnstaple arriving in platform 1 at Exeter St Davids station collided with the rear of another passenger train which was stationary in the platform.  The driver of the train from Barnstaple had applied the brakes to stop behind the other train, but the train did not stop and a collision occurred at a speed of approximately 11 mph (18 km/h).  The collision caused injuries to six passengers and three members of staff.  Four passengers were taken to hospital although none of them were detained.  Both trains suffered minor damage. \n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the application of the brakes did not stop the Barnstaple train before it collided with the Waterloo train. \n\nThe causal factor which led to the derailment was due to a length of low adhesion between the crossing and the end of the platform.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to train operators concerning highlighting within their route risk assessments, route learning and briefing material the possibility of drivers encountering unexpected low adhesion conditions at crossings, and the risk arising from wheel slide where hazards exist immediately beyond a level crossing.\n\nR102010-100621-Exeter-St-Davids.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Exeter St Davids \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_exeter_st_davids_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 14 April 2007 at about 01:00 hours, a Northern Ireland Railways’ (NIR) ultrasonic test train was travelling at approximately 49 mph when it derailed near Cromore, Antrim. No-one was hurt in the derailment, but the vehicle and track were damaged.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was wheel unloading caused by the impact of hitting the regular dips on the track. There were three causal and three contributory factors to the derailment, which includes the excessive speed of the train, the condition of the track and the vehicle’s suspension.\n\nThe underlying cause was the lack of systematic process within NIR for the preparation and issue of the Weekly Operating Notice and Special Operating Instructions.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations in relation to this incident.

'\n  At about 08:10 hrs on 16 April 2008, a train travelling from London (Waterloo) to Windsor & Eton struck and fatally injured a pedestrian on Moor Lane footpath level crossing, near Staines, Surrey. There was no damage to the train or the infrastructure.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian fell to the ground on the crossing and was unable to avoid being struck by the approaching train.\n\nThe RAIB’s investigation identified that causal factors were that the pedestrian did not stop, look and listen before stepping onto the crossing, the surface of the crossing was slippery and Network Rail had not added a non-slip surface to this crossing, although this had been considered by Railtrack in 1996 and requested by Her Majesty’s Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) in 2005.\n\nThere were other contributory factors related to the layout of the approach to the crossing, the relative quietness of the train and the background noise in the area.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB have made four recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail, covering the provision of non-slip surfaces at level crossings, the operation of the computer system used by the maintenance organisation, and the guidance the company gives to its staff who assess and inspect level crossings. Since the accident, Network Rail has fitted a non-slip surface to the level crossing at Moor Lane.\n\nR272008-081223-MoorLane.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Moor Lane, Staines \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_moor_lane_footpath_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On the night of 23 May 2008, a First Great Western passenger train travelling from Paddington to Oxford struck and seriously injured a Network Rail signalling technician who was working on a set of points at Kennington Junction, Oxfordshire. As a result of the injuries received, the technician later had one leg amputated. There was no damage to the train or railway infrastructure.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the signalling technician failed to move to a position of safety when the lookout warned of an approaching train.\n\nSignificant factors in the accident were:\n\n\n  inadequacies in the briefing and implementation of, and compliance with the proposed system of work\n  staff working with an inadequate system of work for times of darkness\n  managerial acceptance of the practice of maintaining points while trains were still permitted to run\n  a lack of clear guidance in the Rule Book and other publications about safe working practices when trains could pass on adjacent lines.\n\n\nRAIB has made several recommendations after previous investigations that are relevant to this incident, but has not repeated them as they are still being dealt with by Network Rail and the Office of Rail Regulation.

These cover the following areas:\n\n\n  investigating the adoption of alternative working methods when maintaining points\n  providing improved guidance on when to use the various means of protecting staff from moving trains\n  providing guidance on the meaning of the terms used in the Rule Book and other publications such as ‘affect the safety of the line’, ‘affect the safety of trains’, ‘affect the safety of train working’, and ‘affect the normal passage of trains’.\n\n\n \nR292009-091112-Kennington-v2.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Kennington Junction \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_kennington_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  \nAt 17:02 hrs on 5 June 2013, a passenger was dragged by a train departing from platform 10 at Newcastle Central station. Her wrist was trapped by an external door of the train and she was forced to move beside it to avoid being pulled off her feet. The train reached a maximum speed of around 5 mph (8 km/h) and travelled around 20 metres before coming to a stop. The train’s brakes were applied either by automatic application following a passenger operating the emergency door release handle, or by the driver responding to an emergency signal from the conductor. The conductor, who was in the rear cab, reported that he responded to someone on the platform shouting at him to stop the train. The passenger suffered severe bruising to her wrist.\n\nThis accident occurred because the conductor did not carry out a safety check before signalling to the driver that the train could depart. Platform 10 at Newcastle Central is a curved platform and safe dispatch is particularly reliant upon following the correct dispatch procedure including undertaking the pre-dispatch safety checks.\n\nThe investigation found that although the doors complied with the applicable train door standard, they were, in certain circumstances, able to trap a wrist and lock without the door obstruction sensing system detecting it. Once the doors were detected as locked, the train was able to move.\n\nIn 2004, although the parties involved in the train’s design and its approval for service were aware of this hazard, the risk associated with it was not formally documented or assessed. The train operator undertook a risk assessment in 2010 following reports of passengers becoming trapped. Although they rated the risk as tolerable, the hazard was not recorded in such a way that it could be monitored and reassessed, either on their own fleet or by operators of similar trains.\n\nAs a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made six recommendations. One of these is for operators of trains with this door design to assess the risk of injuries and fatalities due to trapping and dragging incidents and take the appropriate action to mitigate the risk.\n\nTwo recommendations have been made to the train’s manufacturer. One of these is to reduce the risk of trapping on future door designs, and the other to review its design processes with respect to hazard identification and recording.\n\nOne recommendation has been made to the operator of the train involved in this particular accident. This is related to the management of hazards associated with the design of its trains and assessment of the risks of its train dispatch operations.\n\nTwo recommendations have been made to RSSB. One is to add guidance to the standard on passenger train doors to raise awareness that it may be possible to overcome door obstruction detection even though doors satisfy the tests specified within the standard. The other recommendation is the consideration of additional data which should be recorded within its national safety management information system to provide more complete data relating to the risk of trapping and dragging incidents.\n\nR192014-140918-Newcastle.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Newcastle Central station\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/passenger_incident_newcastle_central_station.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 07:19 hrs on 5 January 2012, the pantograph assembly fell from the roof of a passenger train, breaking two windows on its way to the ground. The train, the 06:51 hrs service from Kings Lynn to London King’s Cross, was travelling at approximately 80 mph (129 km/h), about 2 miles (3.2 km) south of Littleport, in Cambridgeshire, when the accident happened. The train stopped 1.75 miles (2.8 km) after the accident location.\n\nOne passenger received treatment for minor cuts at the site, and two others suffered minor shock but did not require medical treatment. There was extensive damage to the overhead line equipment and minor damage to the train body.\n\nThe investigation identified that the pantograph head had lost contact with, and risen above, the overhead line, resulting in the pantograph arm hitting a cantilever overhead line support structure. This impact broke the electrical insulators on which the pantograph assembly was mounted, allowing it to fall from the roof.\n\nThe pantograph head lost contact because the overhead line was deflected from its intended position due to a combination of long term movements of the overhead line support mast foundations and the force of the wind at the time of the accident.\n\nThe RAIB concluded that maintenance of the overhead line had not been carried out in accordance with Network Rail standards, meaning that the overhead line had not been adjusted to allow for long term foundation movements.\n\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. They are concerned with:\n\n\n  ensuring that the risk associated with the authorisation of non-compliances with maintenance standards are assessed and mitigated\n  providing overhead line maintenance personnel with information that allows them to effectively manage overhead line alignment.\n\n\nThe RAIB has also identified a learning point for the railway industry concerning the possible use of polymeric or composite insulators to support pantographs.\n\nR062013-130520-Littleport-V2.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Littleport \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_involving_a_pantograph_and_the_overhead_line_near_littleport.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 29 September 2009 a collision occurred between a train and a car at the level crossing, at Halkirk, Caithness, resulting in fatal injuries to the three occupants of the car. There were no injuries to anybody on the train which was not derailed. \n\nInvestigation concluded that the driver of the car did not react to the road traffic light signals and drove onto the level crossing at the same time as the train arrived.\n\nAn underlying factor was that Network Rail did not properly understand the risk at Halkirk level crossing because it had not taken the previous accident record into account. Had it done so, the level of risk might have justified more costly risk reduction measures, and risk reduction measures that had been identified might have been implemented more quickly and before the accident occurred.\n\nAdditional observations noted by RAIB include: confusion among the staff undertaking level crossing inspections about the difference between visibility and alignment; and the current design of long hoods fitted to road traffic light signals does not mitigate the effect of falling sunlight for all sun angles.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations to Network Rail which include the risk assessment of the level crossing; the maintenance of the backboards of the road traffic light signals; and the design of long hoods fitted at level crossings.\n\nR162010-100923-Halkirk.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Halkirk \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_halkirk_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 17 January 2015, Eurotunnel freight shuttle 7340 departed from the English terminal of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone at 11:57 hrs, conveying 30 vehicles. The wagons of the front portion of the train did not have any roof structures; they were open topped.  The lorry drivers were travelling in an amenity coach located immediately behind the locomotive at the front of the train.\n\nAt 12:00 hrs, as it was entering the tunnel, the shuttle experienced a loss of electric power from the overhead wires, which caused it to stop.  Three minutes later, once the power was re-established, it set off again.  At around 12:23 hrs a fire was detected on board the shuttle closely followed by a further loss of electric power supply. Three minutes later, the shuttle was brought to a controlled stop.  The shuttle came to rest in the north tunnel beyond the last of two areas dedicated to fire containment, known as SAFE stations. \n\nAll 42 passengers and crew were safely evacuated into the service tunnel less than 15 minutes after the shuttle stopped.  They were taken to the French terminal of the Channel Tunnel system approximately two hours later.\n\nWater walls were set up either side of, and remote from the fire, an hour and a half after the shuttle stopped; these are designed to prevent the fire from spreading to the locomotive and other parts of the train and not to tackle the fire. The fighting of the fire in itself started approximately three and a half hours after shuttle 7340 stopped; the fire was brought under control half an hour later. \n\nThe joint investigation undertaken by the BEA-TT and the RAIB identified: \n\n\n  The immediate cause of the incident was that an over-height aerial on a lorry got too close to the overhead wires and caused an electrical arc at the entrance to the tunnel at 12:00 hrs.  The aerial had not been detected during the loading operations in the UK. The system provided by Eurotunnel to detect over-height aerials was not sensitive enough to reliably detect thin aerials at typical lorry speeds when they passed in front of the system. The electrical arc started a smouldering fire inside the cab of the lorry concerned. It also caused the initial tripping of the overhead power. Eurotunnel dealt with the power loss as an operational incident, as it was unaware of the smouldering fire. \n  CCTV footage indicated that smoke appeared to be developing inside the cab of the incident lorry when the train came to a stand inside the tunnel following the initial power trip. However, as there was no requirement for the train to be inspected following the overhead power line trip, this early sign of a developing fire was not identified and the train was allowed to restart. The smouldering fire remained undetected until 12:23 hrs when the fire alarms were first activated. \n  When the fire alarms were activated, the train was on the approach to the second SAFE station. Given the speed of the train, it remained technically feasible to bring it to a stop in this SAFE station for at least another 1min 30sec. However, the time taken by the control centre to gather the information to inform the line controller’s decision meant that by the time the decision was taken it was too late to stop the train in the SAFE station. Furthermore, when the second power trip occurred, most probably as a result of a tarpaulin or strap being released by the fire and contacting the overhead power line, the various controllers were focused on the fire procedures and no attempt was made to re-energise the overhead power line which very possibly would have allowed the train to exit the tunnel.\n  It took three and a half hours after the train stopped before the intervention team was ready to start the firefighting activities. Almost an hour was lost in conveying the firefighters from the terminal emergency centre to the site of the fire. This delay was due to a non-optimum use of the service vehicles and their drivers.\n  The incident lorry was loaded on a wagon without any roof protection. This type of wagon had originally been supplied with a roof construction. However, the poor integrity of the roof structure had led to its progressive removal. The safety justifications prepared at the time of the removal of the roofs recognised that the removal of the physical barrier increased the likelihood of electrical arcing and the importance of the aerial detection system, but it did not lead to a review as to whether its sensitivity and reliability were adequate, given the increased risk.  It relied on control measures which, while being positive steps towards the protection of assets and operations, did not address the additional risk to passengers and crew.\n\n\nEurotunnel has changed its operating procedures for dealing with an overhead power line trip at the tunnel portals on a train comprising of this type of wagon. It now requires the train involved to stop at the first SAFE station for further investigation.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, the BEA-TT and the RAIB have made six recommendation to Eurotunnel concerning:\n\n\n  The management of the risks associated with over-height objects\n  The continued monitoring of the improvements in the field of fire detection systems\n  The measures needed to limit the likelihood of a train on fire stopping outside of the SAFE stations\n  Eurotunnel’s change management process\n  Eurotunnel’s control of the work done by external bodies\n  The optimisation of the use of the emergency transport system in the service tunnel.\n\n\n160505_ReportET2016_eurotunnel_eng\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fire_on_board_a_freight_shuttle_in_the_channel_tunnel.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On 17 March the driver of a Southern service from Brighton to Watford Junction reported a near miss, after a member of track maintenance staff had dived clear of his train with only seconds to spare.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the system of work implemented at the site did not take into account the possibility of trains switching lines via the crossover on which the team were working. Causal factors were the limited experience of the Controller of Site Safety, and the established system of work did not involve staff moving to a position of safety when trains were approaching on the up fast line. There were two possible other causal factors, and one contributory factor. The underlying cause is the lack of explicit instruction about working under these conditions in the rule book.\n\nRAIB has made eight recommendations as a result of this incident. These are aimed at:\n\n\n  the competency of staff in charge of safety when working in traffic\n  rules and training\n  the identification, recording and briefing of hazards\n  the planning of safe systems of work forms\n  the presentation of information in operating documentation.\n\n\nR432007-071218-Tinsley Green.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Tinsley Green Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near_miss_at_tinsley_green_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 14 July 2013, a passenger train approaching Woodbridge station in Suffolk struck a car at Jetty Avenue user worked level crossing\n\nThe accident occurred in daylight and at low speed. The train was not derailed, but the car driver suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe car driver was using the level crossing to access a private boatyard situated between the railway and the River Deben. He was a volunteer, assisting in removing equipment following a local regatta which had been held partly on land owned by the boatyard earlier in the day. The car driver had used the level crossing on previous occasions, but had not been briefed on its use.\n\nThere were no telephones or warning lights at the crossing so safe use depended on vehicle drivers looking for approaching trains. The car driver, who was an occasional user of the level crosssing, normally relied on checking for trains by looking up and down the railway when swinging open the vehicular gates on foot. He did this because he was aware that his view of the railway would be obscured as he returned to the car and drove it towards the crossing. A curve in the railway meant that the train involved in the accident was not visible to the car driver when he was at the crossing, and could only be seen from this location after the driver had begun to return to his car. The driver did not become aware of the train until he had driven his car into its path.\n\nOur investigation has found that instructions given to car drivers using this, and similar, level crossings were inadequate. It also found that Network Rail’s method for ensuring that vehicle drivers have an adequate view of approaching trains was incompatible with the characteristics of both the car involved in the accident and many of the vehicles expected to use crossings of this type.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations. Four recommendations are addressed to Network Rail and cover the management of level crossings where safe use of the crossing relies on road vehicle drivers seeing approaching trains. One recommendation is made to the Office of Rail Regulation and seeks clarification of its guidance on this issue.\n\nRAIB believes it is possible that the accident at Jetty Avenue user worked crossing could have been avoided by full implementation of two Recommendations in the RAIB report: ‘Investigation into safety at user worked crossings’ (Report 13/2009). These relate to guiding vehicle drivers to stop at an appropriate place before deciding whether it is safe to cross the railway.\n\nR282014_141215_Jetty_Avenue \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Jetty Avenue\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_jetty_avenue_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Sunday 27 August 2006 an unmanned locomotive became uncoupled from the rear of a freight train as it approached Heald Green station, between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport. The locomotive then ran back northwards in the direction the train had come from for around 3 miles, and through a worksite at East Didsbury station. The locomotive then paused momentarily at Burnage station, before returning back southwards because of the gradient and through the worksite again. The train was brought to a stop by a combination of the gradient and workers wedging a wooden post in front of one of the locomotive’s wheels.\n\nThe track workers at East Didsbury station were not positioned on the same line as the runaway locomotive and so there were no injuries. Minor damage was caused to trackside installations.\n\nThe immediate causes of the incident were that the rearmost wagon drawhook broke while the train was on a gradient, and that the trailing locomotive had no air supply available in its air reservoirs to apply the brakes. The report identified five causal factors, eight contributory factors and two underlying causes for the incident.\n\nRAIB has made eight recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  the design of the type of locomotive involved, and how equipment therein is described and labelled\n  wagon maintenance procedures\n  driver training and assessment\n  reviewing how critical information is passed to drivers and their understanding of it is assessed\n  processes for identifying and mitigating hazards introduced by technical or operational change.\n\n\nR132007-070524-East-Didsbury.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for East Didsbury\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/locomotive_runaway_near_east_didsbury.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  Road-rail vehicles are vehicles that can travel on the road and, by means of a rail guidance system, on railway track. They are used during the maintenance and renewal of the railway infrastructure. The most common example is the wheeled excavator, but there are many other types.\n\nRAIB was concerned about the number of runaways involving road-rail vehicles and trailers and decided to carry out a class investigation to determine whether there are sufficient controls in place that should prevent the occurrence of runaways and whether these are properly implemented.\n\nRAIB’s investigation identified that:\n\n\n  the biggest proportion of runaways has occurred during the process whereby a road-rail vehicle transfers from road to rail, or rail to road. If not carried out correctly, an unbraked situation can arise on some road-rail vehicles\n  other runaway incidents have occurred during braking where wet rails, possibly in combination with contamination of the rail head, have caused the wheels to slide and braking distances to be extended\n  since the fatal accident at Tebay, there have been no further incidents of trailer runaways, although there have since been runaway incidents where trailers have been coupled to road-rail vehicles.\n\n\nDuring the course of the RAIB’s investigation, Network Rail carried out its own investigation into the safety of road-rail vehicles and trailers. This did not specifically focus on runaways but has made recommendations on the design of new road-rail vehicles and the content of training courses that complement some of the recommendations made by RAIB in its report.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made three recommendations aimed at Network Rail:\n\n\n  Network Rail should use a systems engineering process to manage the specification, design, operation and maintenance of road-rail vehicles\n  Network Rail should assess the safety of existing road-rail vehicles, using safety analysis methods, to determine whether the current technical and operational controls in place are sufficient to stop road-rail vehicles running away\n  Network Rail should improve the level of reporting of incidents involving road-rail vehicles.\n\n\nR272009-091029-RRV.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for RRV runaways\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/investigation_into_runaways_of_road-rail_vehicles_and_their_trailers.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 07:25 hrs on 4 February 2010, a quantity of stone ballast fell from the bottom doors of a wagon in a freight train, running from Acton, west London, to Ipswich, as it passed through Romford station in Essex at about 59 mph (95 km/h). Stones bounced onto the station platform, and struck three people, two of whom subsequently required treatment for minor injuries. \n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that ballast fell through an open door on one of the wagons and ricocheted off the track onto the platform.\n\nThe causal factors were: the leading bottom discharge doors on wagon 14513 were open when the train left Acton and when it passed through Romford; the position of the lock handles on the PGA wagon can lead staff to believe that the doors are closed and locked when the doors are actually partially or fully open: the design of the mechanism permits this condition to exist.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to the company that operated the freight train, relating to modifications to the type of wagon involved in the incident, instructions and methods for checking that doors are properly closed, training and competence of staff, and the management of safety.\n\nR202010-101209-Romford.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Romford station \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/incident_at_romford_station.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 19:55 hrs on 21 January 2013, a freight train consisting of 26 empty wagons, hauled by a diesel locomotive, derailed at Castle Donington, Leicestershire. The eighteenth wagon derailed first, followed by the nineteenth and twentieth wagons. Subsequently, the train divided between the nineteenth and twentieth wagons, causing the brake to apply. There was extensive track damage, but no-one was hurt.\n\nThe immediate cause was that cyclic top before the point of derailment excited the suspension of the eighteenth wagon causing the left-hand leading wheel to become unloaded and to derail to the left. There had been a recurrence of cyclic top faults in the vicinity of where the derailment occurred, and the routine inspection and maintenance had not kept the track in an acceptable condition. In particular, planned stoneblowing on 20 November 2012, which should have included the track through the point of derailment, stopped before reaching it due to shortage of time.\n\nAn underlying factor was that the ballast supporting the track was fouled, causing the track to be inadequately supported and leading to the recurrent cyclic top. The need to renew the ballast had been identified, but the work was not programmed to be carried out until 2016/17. This was in line with Network Rail’s policy for renewals on the route.\n\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations, one directed to Network Rail and one to RSSB. The recommendation to Network Rail covers reviewing, and if necessary, improving the planning of stoneblowing so that there is sufficient time to complete the work. The recommendation to RSSB (in conjunction with the rail industry) is to review the current Rule Book requirements relating to the action required following an abnormal brake application, and to make any changes found necessary to reduce the risk of trains colliding with a derailed rail vehicle.\n\nThe RAIB has also identified three learning points about:\n\n\n  checking track, following the passage of trains, after lifting and packing work\n  using appropriately qualified staff to raise speed restrictions following work to remedy poor track condition\n  staff communicating safety information so that it is clearly and accurately understood.\n\n\nR022014-140116-Castle-Donington.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Castle Donington\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_castle_donington.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 07:35 hrs on 25 June 2013 a passenger train was involved in a near-miss with a car on a level crossing near Butterswood in North Lincolnshire. The train passed over the level crossing with the barriers in the raised position and the road traffic signals extinguished. No injuries or damage were caused as a result of the incident.\n\nNormally, the approach of the train would have automatically initiated the closure of the crossing. However, the crossing was not working normally because the power supply to the crossing equipment had been interrupted. The crossing was of a type where train drivers are required to check that it is not obstructed as they approach and that it has operated correctly. A flashing light is provided for this purpose, just before the crossing, with a flashing white light displayed if the crossing has correctly closed against road users, and a flashing red light displayed at all other times (including those occasions when the crossing has failed to close on the approach of a train). The driver of the train involved in the near-miss did not notice until it was too late to stop that the flashing light was indicating that the crossing was not working normally, and was still open for road traffic.\n\nRAIB’s investigation found that the train driver had the expectation that the crossing would operate normally as the train approached and that he had not focused his attention on the flashing light at the point where he needed to confirm that the crossing had operated correctly for the passage of his train. Although the level crossing had probably failed around nine hours before the incident, the fact of its failure was not known to any railway staff.\n\nThe investigation also found that the crossing was not protected with automatic warning system equipment and that the maintenance arrangements at the crossing were not effective in ensuring reliable performance of the equipment. In addition, the train operator’s briefing material did not clearly explain to drivers their role in respect of failures at this type of level crossing.\n\nRAIB has identified four key learning points relating to non-provision of the automatic warning system at locations where it is mandated by standards, recording of the condition of assets during inspection, storage of batteries, and involving people with relevant technical expertise in industry investigations into incidents and accidents.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail addressing the indications given to train drivers approaching crossings where they are required to monitor the crossing’s status, improvements to the reliability of power supplies to crossings such as Butterswood and considering remote monitoring of the power supply at similar crossings. One recommendation has been made to First TransPennine Express regarding the briefing that it gives its drivers on this type of level crossing.\n\nR122014-140616-Butterswood.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Butterswood\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near-miss_at_butterswood_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  Early on the morning of 1 February 2008, at Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, the 06:13 hrs Nottingham to Norwich train collided with debris from a footbridge that had been knocked down by the raised body of a tipper lorry a short time earlier. The train derailed and continued on for 170 metres.\n\nThe cab of the train was severely damaged due to it colliding with the debris from the footbridge. The driver of the train, the guard and one of the passengers were taken to hospital. The guard and the passenger were released later that day and the driver early the next morning. The cab of the tipper lorry was also severely damaged; however, its driver escaped injury.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the train was unable to stop before it hit the debris from the footbridge. The footbridge was demolished because the raised body of the tipper lorry collided with it. The driver forgot to fully lower the body of the tipper because he was distracted from his normal routine by having to unlock the cab passenger door to allow access for a member of railway staff.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made recommendations targeted at Network Rail that relate to:\n\n\n  the assessment of risks during transit operation of road vehicles on their land near to the running line\n  a review of arrangements to ensure that correct protection is used when undertaking work on or near the running line.\n\n\nRAIB has also recommended that the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) examines designing trains to mitigate the consequences of derailment.\n\nR182008-080925-BarrowUponSoar.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Barrow upon Soar \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_barrow_upon_soar.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 19 March 2006 a “one” London Liverpool Street to Ipswich service was travelling at 80mph under clear signals when it struck two wheelbarrows as it approached Manor Park station. The staff on the track with the wheelbarrows had been able to jump clear, but two workers were injured.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was the presence of a workgroup on the track outside the limits of a possession and without any means of protection. There were four causal factors and eight contributory factors to the incident. The underlying cause was the planning of complex work sites to encompass multiple jobs over many miles.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:\n\n\n  minimising of work site lengths within possessions\n  improving planning procedures\n  storing archived data.\n\n\nR262007-070725-Manor-Park-v2.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Manor Park\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/possession_irregularity_near_manor_park.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At approximately 13:43 hrs on 16 July 2012, train 2H33, the 13:04 hrs service from Cambridge to London Liverpool Street was approaching a bridge just north of Roydon station, Essex, at a speed of 62 mph (100 km/h). As it did so, two track workers had to run from the bridge in order to avoid being struck by the train. The last of these track workers got clear of the railway line around two seconds before the train passed them.\n\nAt the time of the incident, these track workers were working on a line which was open to railway traffic. They were being protected by a system of work which relied on a lookout to provide warning of approaching trains. If established correctly, such a system should allow track workers to reach a position of safety at least 10 seconds before a train arrives.\n\nThis incident occurred because the group’s lookout was not able to give the track workers on the bridge sufficiently early warning of the approach of train 2H33. This was because the controller of site safety (COSS) responsible for protecting the group from train movements had implemented a system of work which was nappropriate, given the nature of the task and the location in which it was being undertaken.\n\nThe system of work implemented by the COSS had been issued by a planner, who had selected it as an appropriate system based on his knowledge of the location and his previous experience of working on the track. It is possible that this incident could have been avoided had the planner sought approval for the system from a more senior person before it was issued, as is required by Network Rail’s standards.\n\nThe inexperience of the COSS and the group in implementing this type of system of work was an underlying factor in the accident. The short time-frame in which the work was planned and the experience of the planner were also possible underlying factors.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the RAIB has identified two key learning points. These concern the need to keep the late planning of work to a minimum and for persons undertaking the duties of a COSS to follow the requirements of Network Rail’s standards when issued with a system of work on the same shift that a task is to be undertaken.\n\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations, both addressed to Network Rail. These relate to improving the way in which available sighting distances are assessed by persons undertaking the duties of a COSS or a planner. The RAIB has also restated a previous recommendation addressed to Network Rail which relates to the manner in which training and assessment can deliver practical competences.\n\nR072013-130627-Roydon.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Roydon\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/dangerous_occurrence_near_roydon_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 11 October 2009, at 14:35 hrs, train 1Z75, the 13:30 hrs charter service from London Waterloo, derailed at low speed as it arrived at Windsor and Eton Riverside station. The train was formed of a class 73 locomotive leading a five-car Class 201 Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU), with two further class 73 locomotives on the rear. \n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was that the track was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 1Z75 passed over. \n\nThe causal factors which led to the incident were: a discrepancy in recording the poor condition of the sleepers which led to the actual fault being subject to a lower level of surveillance by the Track Section Manager; the condition of the sleepers at Windsor and Eton Riverside station had not been reported on a weekly basis; that action was not taken by the Track Section Manager to replace the decaying sleepers; the Track Maintenance Engineer not following up his request for the work to be undertaken; non-identification of the widening gauge in platform 1 at Windsor and Eton Riverside; and the non-application of tie-bars as a temporary measure. \n\nRAIB has made three recommendations to Network Rail regarding revisions to its current competency training programme for all staff involved in track inspection; development of a proposal for the periodic measurement of dynamic gauge at potentially vulnerable locations not covered by a track recording vehicle; and ensuring that its procedures for planning audits are amended to a review of the findings from previous relevant audits and action taken.\n\nR112010-100805-Windsor.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Windsor and Eaton Riverside \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_windsor_and_eton_riverside_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 06:23 hrs on 21 March 2013, a car drove around the barriers of Athelney automatic half barrier crossing, near Taunton in Somerset. This took the car into the path of a train which was approaching the crossing at high speed. The driver of the car was killed in the resulting collision.\n\nThe motorist drove around the barriers without waiting for a train to pass and the barriers to re-open. The level crossing was closed to road traffic for longer than normal before the arrival of the train, because of earlier engineering work that had affected the automatic operation of the crossing. The motorist may have believed that the crossing had failed with the barriers in the closed position, or that the approaching train had been delayed. He did not contact the signaller by telephone before he drove around the barriers.\n\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail. These relate to reducing the risk resulting from extended operating times of automatic level crossings and to modifying the location of the pedestrian stop lines at Athelney level crossing. A further recommendation is addressed to Network Rail in conjunction with RSSB, to consider means of improving the presentation of telephones at automatic level crossings for non-emergency use. One recommendation is addressed to the Office of Rail Regulation, to incorporate any resulting improvements which are reasonably practicable into the guidance it publishes on level crossings.\n\nR042014-140224-Athelney.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Athelney level crossing\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_athelney_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  In the incident at Brentwood, at around 10:12 hrs on 4 November 2007 a machine operator and a machine controller (a person authorised to control and supervise an item of on-track plant on the railway) were putting a Basket 14 road-rail vehicle (RRV), a mobile elevating work platform (MEWP), on the track near Brentwood station when it ran away westward to Romford and London.\n\nThe operator and machine controller were unable to stop the RRV before it gathered speed. After travelling some four miles, the machine left the section of line that had been blocked to give protection from running trains and the operator, who was in the work basket, jumped clear. The machine ran for a further three miles before Network Rail staff were able to stop it west of Romford station. The operator was injured and required out-patient hospital treatment.\n\nIn the incident at Birmingham Snow Hill, at around 02:30 hrs on 31 October 2007, a TD-18 RRV (another type of MEWP) was being removed from the track near Birmingham Snow Hill station when it ran away. It collided with a Basket 14 RRV parked 10-15 metres away. There were two persons in the work basket of the Basket 14 RRV and another was in the driving cab of the TD-18 RRV. They all managed to move clear before the collision and no-one was injured.\n\nThe RAIB decided to conduct a joint investigation into these incidents as the similarities between the two – the vehicle types involved, the operations taking place and the parties involved – highlighted the likelihood of common safety learning.\n\nThe RAIB has identified two causal factors for the incident at Brentwood, and one for the incident at Birmingham. All three concern the site practices involved in placing the RRVs on and off the track.\n\nThe RAIB has also identified thre further contributory factors for each event.\n\nAs a consequence of these incidents, the RAIB has targeted six recommendations at Network Rail, the owner of the infrastructure on which the RRVs were being used, to address causal and contributory factors. They concern procedures and training for on/off-tracking RRVs, the training given on Network Rail’s competency scheme for machine controllers and a review of MEWPs to decide if modifications are required to prevent the possibility of an unbraked condition during on/off-tracking.\n\n \nR112009-090527-Brentwood.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Brentwood and Snow Hill\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/road-rail_vehicle_runaway_incidents_brentwood_and_snow_hill.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 05:20 hrs on Sunday 25 May 2014, the third vehicle of an empty five car class 360/2 passenger train manufactured by Siemens and operated by Heathrow Express derailed while it was running along platform 3 at London Paddington station. All four wheels on the leading bogie of the third vehicle became derailed on a track defect which, according to Network Rail’s standards, required a repair within 36 hours. No one was injured as a result of the derailment.\n\nThe derailment occurred because the bogies of the third vehicle were incorrectly set up, which resulted in the left-hand wheels of the leading bogie being partially unloaded even when stationary. The track defect along platform 3 exacerbated this unloading and contributed to the derailment.\n\nThe investigation has found that the incorrect setup was the result of the repeated implementation by Siemens technicians of a procedure aimed at setting the vehicle ride heights following tyre turning or bogie replacement. This procedure did not clearly instruct the technicians on how to adjust one of the bogie components (the anti-roll bar) which resulted in the technicians setting it in such a way as to create the wheel load imbalance. None of the checks in the procedure identified the incorrect setup because these checks were not monitoring parameters likely to provide a clear indication of a wheel load imbalance. An underlying factor was the lack of effective transfer of design information about the role and importance of the anti-roll bars between the vehicle designers (Siemens Germany) and the vehicle maintainers (Siemens UK).\n\nThe track defect had been repeatedly identified by Network Rail’s measurements of track geometry for at least three years. However the required processes to remedy the defect were not followed and this was not picked up by Network Rail’s assurance process.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the RAIB has made four recommendations to Siemens and one to Network Rail. The recommendations to Siemens relate to the revision of the procedure used to set the vehicle ride heights, training materials and competence assessments to capture the function of anti-roll bars, their method of adjustment and the risks associated with incorrect setup. The recommendations also cover a review of other maintenance procedures and a review of the effectiveness of Siemens’ recently developed processes for transfer of design information into maintenance procedures.\n\nThe recommendation on Network Rail is to review its supervision and self-assurance arrangements to identify shortcomings which led to the non-compliances with a mandated standard going unnoticed.\n\nR032015_150430_Paddington \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Paddington station \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_paddington_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 10.50hrs on Wednesday 29 August 2007, a train was driven through an emergency speed restriction of 20 mph between Newtown and Caersws on the Shrewsbury to Machynlleth line, close to Ty Mawr farm crossing at a speed of 75mph, reducing to 58 mph. There were no casualties, and no damage, as a result.\n\nThe RAIB’s investigation identified that the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver forgot the advice he had been given of the emergency speed restriction. Causal factors were the lack of a means both within the driving cab and at the side of the track to remind the driver of the speed restriction ahead.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident RAIB has made seven recommendations, five targeted at Network Rail, one at the Rail Safety and Standards Board and one at the Association of Train Operating Companies.\n\nThe recommendations cover procedures for informing emergency speed restrictions to drivers, and reminding them of their existence, when they are imposed at a significant distance from their location.\n\nR222008-081030-Ty-Mawr.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Ty Mawr\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/overspeeding_incident_at_ty_mawr_farm_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 10:01 hrs on 26 October 2013, an unattended commercial vehicle on the B5299 Brayton Road, Aspatria, ran away down the road.\n\nThe vehicle crossed the main A596 Lawson Street, broke through a wooden fence and rolled down the side of a cutting onto the railway. Although a passenger train from Carlisle to Lancaster was approaching Aspatria at the same time, prompt action by those concerned resulted in this train being stopped about 2.4 km (1.5 miles) from the incident site. There was therefore no collision with the commercial vehicle on the track, and none of the passengers or crew on the train were actually put at risk.\n\nThe management of road vehicle incursions onto the railway is described in guidance published by the Department for Transport (DfT). RAIB’s investigation found that the guidance does not explain how to assess the risk of a vehicle that has lost control on a side road (eg a runaway on a side road with a downhill gradient towards the railway). Also, the guidance does not describe how this risk should be combined with the risk of road vehicle incursion from the corresponding main road to give an overall risk ranking score.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations; the first to the DfT to review and amend the guidance on road vehicle incursions; and the second to railway infrastructure managers, with highway authorities, to provide additional mitigation against vehicle incursions at sites where there is a significant risk of road vehicles from side roads, including of vehicles running downhill onto the railway.\n\nR142014-140626-Aspatria.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Aspatria \n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/road_vehicle_incursion_onto_the_railway_at_aspatria.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At about 10:48 hrs on 25 January 2008, the tenth wagon of freight train 6M49 - the 09:02 hrs service from Immingham Docks to Rugeley Power Station - derailed on a plain line at Santon, between Wrawby Junction and Foreign Ore Branch Junction, Scunthorpe. The front four wheels of the wagon, which was loaded with coal, left the rails, and the train continued for just over a mile before stopping. No one was injured in this derailment, but there was considerable damage to the railway infrastructure and the line was subsequently closed for over a week while repairs were carried out.\n\nRAIB’s investigation identified that the immediate cause of the accident was that the front right-hand wheel of the wagon rode over the rail as the train traversed a left hand curve at Santon. This was because the load on this wheel was significantly reduced by the combined effect of a number of track geometry faults close to each other. The local Network Rail inspection and maintenance regime had not detected that these faults, which had been addressed by maintenance action three months prior to the derailment, had re-occurred.\n\nThe track geometry was deteriorating rapidly because of considerable amounts of water running in the formation beneath it. No-one reported or responded to the signs of water and poor drainage around the point of derailment. The load on the first wheel to derail was also reduced by coal being unevenly loaded in the wagon.\n\nAs a consequence of this accident, RAIB has made eight recommendations targeted at the infrastructure owner Network Rail relating to track inspection and maintenance standards, track drainage at Santon, the identification of the exact location of rapid track deterioration, the monitoring of track repair quality and guidance about action to take if water affects the track.\n\nOne further recommendation to address the uneven loading of the wagon is targeted at Freightliner Group Limited.\n\n \nR102009-090430-ForeignOre.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Foreign Ore Branch \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_santon.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At 14:34 hrs on 23 January 2013 a class 47 diesel electric locomotive derailed on a small radius curve, approaching Ordsall Lane Junction in Salford, and caught fire. The locomotive derailed to the outside of the curve. It was being hauled on the rear of an empty train, which was formed of another class 47 locomotive and five coaches.\n\nThe cause of the derailment was that the lateral forces acting at the wheel-rail interface, as the locomotive negotiated the curve, were sufficient to cause the leading right-hand wheel to climb the rail. Despite being required by standards, there was no check rail on the curve. This safeguard would have restricted the lateral displacement of the wheels and prevented the derailment.\n\nThe RAIB found that the following factors had resulted in the lateral forces being high enough to initiate wheel climbing conditions:\n\n\n  The dry and clean state of the inside face of the outer rail on the curve that enabled high levels of wheel-rail contact friction to be established; recently-modified arrangements for lubricating the rails did not prevent this\n  Machining work that had recently been undertaken to restore the wheel profiles on the locomotive; this removed any pre-existing lubricant and contaminant from the locomotive wheels that would otherwise have helped reduce wheel-rail contact friction levels\n  The relatively low angle of contact between the wheel and rail associated with the newly-restored wheels on the locomotive; this reduced the locomotive’s ability to resist the climbing forces acting at the wheel-rail interface\n  The wider than normal distance between the rails (track gauge) that had developed on the curve.\n\n\nThe above combined to generate the conditions necessary for derailment, but none of these factors involved non-compliance with applicable standards.\n\nAlthough it was found that the reprofiling of the wheels had left the wheel surface slightly rougher than specified, the RAIB decided not to investigate this factor any further. This was because the surface was only marginally non-compliant and there is contradictory evidence regarding its effect on wheel-rail friction.\n\nThe basic approach to managing the risk of derailment on small radius curves on the national network relies on vehicles and track complying with separate technical standards. However, because these standards do not require consideration of the worst possible combination of conditions, there remains a residual risk of derailment. It is generally recognised by the railway industry that the level of this residual risk is reduced by certain traditional features, such as check rails and trackside rail lubricators. Therefore, although not generally relied upon, RAIB observed that any change in the provision of such features has the potential to reduce the overall level of derailment safety. \n\nR072014-140331-Ordsall-Lane-Junction.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Ordsall Lane Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_ordsall_lane_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At around 15:50 hrs on 3 October 2011, a pedestrian was struck and fatally injured by a train on Mexico footpath crossing, near Penzance in Cornwall. On approaching the crossing round a curve, the train driver had observed a person standing to the side of the line and had sounded the warning horn immediately before the train reached the crossing. However, the pedestrian then attempted to cross and was struck.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to be certain why the pedestrian attempted to cross, RAIB considers that she either misjudged the speed of the approaching train or misjudged her position in relation to the approaching train. She probably saw the train too late to make a reasoned judgement about whether she should cross.\n\nThe driver had also sounded the train’s horn as required by a lineside ‘whistle’ board when the train was approximately 15-16 seconds from the crossing, and out of sight. If the pedestrian had heard and responded to the sounding of the train’s horn at this stage, it is likely that she would not have passed through the gate and onto the crossing until the train had passed. RAIB considers that the sounding of the horn when the train was 15-16 seconds from the crossing did not serve its function of warning the crossing user of the approaching train for one of the following reasons:\n\n\n  the sound of the horn was inaudible to her\n  she heard a horn being sounded, but did not distinguish it as coming from a train\n  she did not register that the train horn was sounded, because she was only approaching the crossing at this time and not yet focused on crossing the railway.\n\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations. Three recommendations have been made to Network Rail regarding improvements to sighting and warning arrangements for pedestrians using Mexico footpath crossing, developing a national approach to the location and marking of decision points at level crossings and optimising warning arrangements for pedestrians at level crossings provided with whistle boards. One recommendation (in two parts) has been made to RSSB regarding improving intelligence on near-miss incidents at level crossings and enhancing its processes for reviewing the effect of changes made in 2007 to arrangements for sounding train horns at whistle boards. One recommendation has been made to First Great Western regarding a change to standards to require objective testing of horns after a train has been involved in an incident or accident.\n\nR102012-120621-Mexico-FPC.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Mexico footpath crossing \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_mexico_footpath_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  An operating irregularity occurred at 10:38 hrs on 27 August 2007 on the single line between Aylesbury and Claydon L&NE Junction. A freight locomotive was standing on the single line without the necessary authority. A passenger train was then signalled onto the same line. The passenger train driver saw the locomotive ahead in time to stop without significant risk of collision.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified a mistake by the shunter, a member of the freight train staff, as the immediate cause of the incident. The causal factor was poor safety-critical communications between the train staff and signaller. Contributory factors included issues relating to the training and rostering of local staff and a conflict between the local instructions for the line and the rule book.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to English Welsh and Scottish Railway (EWS) and other freight operators. These recommendations concern instructions for operating single lines and the rostering of staff to locations.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail and the operators who use the line. This recommendation concerns the operating instructions for this line.\n\nIn addition, RAIB has made one recommendation targeted at the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB).

'\n  On Saturday 14 January 2006 a train loaded with ballast left a section of line that was under engineers’ possession without authority, and ran onto a line open to other traffic. It was diverted onto a line on which a passenger train was approaching from the opposite direction. The ballast train stopped in Haymarket station when the driver realised he was travelling on the wrong line, and the passenger train was stopped by the signaller.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was that the driver of the ballast train left the engineering possession without obtaining authority from the signaller. There were eight causal factors, and two contributory factors to the incident.\n\nSubsequently, during tests on the brakes of the ballast train, one wagon became detailed. There were no injuries, and minor damage to a set of points. The immediate cause of the derailment was a fitter carrying out a brake test while the train was standing over points that had been damaged in the first incident. There was one causal factor.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations as a result of its investigation. These cover:\n\n\n  revisions to the rules governing the management of engineering possessions;\n  the competence of staff; and\n  the planning of engineering work on the railway.\n\n\nR032007-070130-Haymarket.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Haymarket\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/unauthorised_train_movement_and_derailment_at_haymarket.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 19:04 hrs on 23 September 2014, a train driver received a severe electric shock at Sutton Weaver, Cheshire. He had stopped his train having seen damaged overhead power supply wires ahead of it. Following a call to the signaller, he left his train and came close to, or made contact with, an electrically live wire which had broken and was low hanging. The train driver suffered serious injuries.\n\nThis accident occurred because one of the overhead wires had broken, was hanging down and was electrically live. Two previous trains had come into contact with this hanging wire and consequently tripped the power supply circuit breakers. Each time the circuit breakers had been reset by the Electrical Control Operators in accordance with procedures to make the overhead wires electrically live again. The driver had left the train to obtain information as to his location to assist in restoring train services as he was trained to do, but did not see the broken wire.\n\nThe investigation found that the wire broke as some of its strands had fractured due to fatigue, likely initiated and progressed from a high stress area related to an attachment supporting the overhead wire.\n\nThe RAIB has made two recommendations. One is for Network Rail to extend the scope of its detailed overhead line examinations to inspect for signs of wire damage at these attachment positions.\n\nThe other recommendation is for RSSB, who are the custodian of the railway Rule Book, to review whether clarification is needed relating to the actions that train crew should take if they are required to leave a train where the OLE is known to be damaged and still live.\n\nFollowing a review of the actions of those involved in attending to the injured driver, one learning point has been made reminding train operators of the importance of contacting the signaller by the quickest means in emergency situations.\n\nR072015_150624_Sutton_Weaver\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Sutton Weaver\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/severe_injury_sustained_at_sutton_weaver.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Monday 06 February 2006 a vehicle in an engineering train became derailed on a set of points at the north end of Carlisle station. All the wheels of a plough brake van at the rear of the train derailed. Minor damage was caused to the vehicle and the track, and there were no injuries.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the ballast plough at the leading end of the brake van coming into contact with an adjacent running rail on the approach to the points. Causal factors were the failure to engage the locking keys when stowing the plough after its previous use, and the lack of any process to ensure locking keys are put in place before moving the plough brake van.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation:\n\n\n  Two recommendations covering working procedures to prevent a recurrence of this incident \n  Four recommendations to address poor practices that were observed during the investigation, but did not contribute to the derailment.\n\n\nR172006-060919-Carlisle.PDF\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Carlisle\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_carlisle.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 23:39 hrs on 20 July 2010, a machine operator was placing a road-rail excavator onto the railway near Drumrosach farm, near Raigmore, Inverness. As the machine was being placed on the track it began to run down the gradient. The people who were in attendance were unable to stop the machine before it gathered speed.\n\nThe machine ran for 0.88 miles (1.41 km) with the machine operator on board, and then collided, at between 40 and 50 mph (64 to 80 km/h), with the rear of a stationary freight train which was standing on the bridge over the line that runs between Inverness and Aberdeen.\n\nIn the collision, the machine operator was thrown out of the cab and landed on top of the rear wagon of the freight train, sustaining serious injuries. The excavator was derailed by all wheels and the leading axle of the rear wagon became derailed. Both the excavator and the freight wagon sustained damage.\n\nRAIB’s investigation identified that the excavator was placed into an unbraked condition while being manoeuvred onto the track. This is likely to have occurred due to a combination of operator errors and a transient single point failure of the machine’s control system. The machine operator was then unable to slow, derail or stop the excavator as it ran away.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations relating to modifications to the design of the excavator, a review of the safety requirements that are specified for this type of machine, and a review of the training of people who control this type of machine on site.\n\nR102011-110711-Raigmore.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Raigmore\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/runaway_and_collision_near_raigmore.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  During the evening of 28 November 2009, a London to Yeovil train ran into a landslip in a cutting on the eastern approach to Gillingham tunnel in Dorset. The leading carriage of the train became derailed and the train ran into the tunnel and stopped 200 metres inside. The landslip was caused by water overflowing from a blocked ditch at the top of the cutting slope. Two passengers reported minor injuries and the leading carriage of the train and around 450 metres of railway track were damaged. \n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was a landslip triggered by water overflowing from a blocked ditch.\n\nThe causal factors were: the Victorian cutting design did not take adequate account of the interaction between geology, groundwater and heavy rainfall; roots were not dealt with properly during maintenance work and the person who inspected the ditch did not have appropriate guidance about how to deal with roots; there was no Network Rail process for establishing the drainage ditch condition; and there had been a lack of action in response to an earlier memorandum.\n\nRAIB has made five recommendations to Network Rail relating to management of drainage and earthworks.  These include a recommendation to identify, and then adequately maintain, drainage which is required for railway safety but is not located close to the railway tracks.\n\nR192010-101028-Gillingham-Tunnel.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Gillingham tunnel \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_near_gillingham_tunnel.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Wednesday 02 November a manually propelled trolley being used within an engineering possession on the partially built Larkhall branch in Scotland ran away from the trolley operator. It travelled over three miles down hill and ran onto a railway line open to traffic. The trolley came to a stand within Barncluith tunnel where a possible collision with a passenger train was prevented by the trolley activating a track circuit within the tunnel.\n\nThe immediate causes of the runaway were the use of a heavily loaded trolley on a steeper gradient than permitted, the brake lining material, and the contamination of the brake linings by a mixture of mud, fuel and oil.\n\nRAIB has made sixteen recommendations as a result of its investigation.

'\n  On 29 April 2007 at 11.26am, an empty stock train, 5Z71, was travelling from Old Oak Common depot to Reading depot when it struck and fatally injured a track welder at Ruscombe Junction. The accident occurred as the train passed a high-speed crossover where the welder was carrying out repair work. The two other on-site workers were unharmed and the train did not sustain any damage.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the welding team did not move to a position of safety as train 5Z71 approached, which resulted in the welder being hit by the train. There were two contributory factors which involved the decision-making of the on-site team and the train driver’s actions as he approached the track workers. The investigation also identified that an air ambulance helicopter landed on the railway lines without the proper authority.\n\nRAIB has made seven recommendations as a result of this incident. These involve:\n\n\n  the identifying and recording of hazards and reducing the proportion of weld repairs at points and crossovers\n  research into the impact of peer pressure, group communications and dynamics on safety decision-making in site safety teams\n  the training of train drivers\n  implementing the protocol governing the landing of air ambulance helicopters at rail incidents.\n\n\nR042008-080228-Ruscombe.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Ruscombe Junction \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_ruscombe_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  During the afternoon of 22 September 2014, a group of nine track workers repairing a section of the West Coast Main Line south of Hest Bank level crossing, near Lancaster, narrowly avoided being struck by a southbound passenger train.  Their site of work was located on a bend which restricted visibility of approaching trains.  Warning of approaching trains was intended to be given by lookouts, located remotely with good visibility of the track, using a radio-based lookout operated warning system (LOWS).  The system had been working normally prior to the incident, but the workgroup did not receive a warning for the incident train.\n\nThe track workers saw the approaching train with just enough time to clear the track before it passed them while travelling at 98 mph (158 km/h).  They were shaken by the incident, but not physically injured.  All work on the site was stopped for the remainder of the shift.\n\nThe incident was caused because a lookout did not give a warning, either because he operated the wrong switch on his radio transmitter by mistake, or because he forgot about the need to send a warning during an intended delay period between seeing the train and operating the warning switches.  This delay was because he was positioned on a long section of straight track and could see approaching trains for significantly longer than the time required for the workgroup to move into a position of safety.  A previous RAIB recommendation intended to mitigate this risk had not been implemented due to administrative errors.  It is probable that the lookout’s vigilance had degraded as he had been working continuously for almost two hours.  Although unrelated to the incident, the RAIB identified that a safety-critical element of the LOWS circuitry was not subject to routine testing.\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail covering the management of working time for tasks which depend on vigilance, and the circumstances in which LOWS should be used.\n\nR082015_150716_Hest_Bank\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Hest Bank\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near_miss_at_hest_bank.txt','Heavy rail'

The 25 passengers on the train were evacuated safely.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate causes of the collision were:\n\n\n  that the grinding machines were placed on a section of railway that was open to train operations\n  that neither the person responsible for the safety of the track workers nor the person who planned their safe system of work had adequate geographical knowledge of the Acton area. \n\n\nIn addition:\n\n\n  The format of the safety information provided to the people working on the site was confusing, as it did not contain track layout diagrams; and was presented in an inconsistent format\n  The person responsible for the safety of the track workers on site did not check the detail of the safety information provided\n  A key member of staff on site who may have had an opportunity to identify the error that was about to be made did not do so; this was because he was distracted by having to perform a number of tasks at the same time\n  There were weak management arrangements in place at the track workers’ home depot, which permitted non-compliances with Network Rail’s procedures for securing the safety of staff on site\n  London-area planning meetings in Network Rail’s Western route did not discuss access arrangements for staff working on site, despite being mandated to do so by the company’s own procedures.\n\n\nAs a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made eight recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail.

'\n  At around 18:45 hrs on Sunday 11 May 2014, a passenger train approaching the village of Frampton Mansell, in Gloucestershire, struck a motorcycle on Frampton level crossing. The rider of the motorcycle was fatally injured. The train did not derail, and there were no reported injuries to anyone on the train.\n\nThe rider was crossing the railway on a trail bike, a type of motorcycle designed for use on public roads and for off-road use. He was the last of a group of three riders who had reached the level crossing along an unsurfaced track leading from a minor road near the village of Sapperton.\n\nSignage on the approach to the crossing instructed vehicle users (which would include trail bike riders) to use a telephone located close to the crossing. This allowed the railway signaller to tell users whether it was safe to cross the railway. The riders did not use the telephone because they believed that they could cross safely by looking for trains before crossing, and because the signs did not grab their attention sufficiently for them to read the information on them. The riders did not know that a curve in the railway meant that they could not rely on seeing an approaching train early enough to decide whether it was safe to cross. The train’s warning horn was sounded as it approached, but the trail bike riders could not hear this because they were wearing full-face crash helmets and their trail bike engines were noisy. Network Rail had received some information that trail bikers were using the crossing, but had not taken effective action to manage the associated risk of unsafe use.\n\nAlthough permitted to use vehicles on both approaches to the level crossing, the trail bike riders were unaware they were not among the people permitted to use vehicles on the crossing. The signs giving instructions to vehicle users did not explain this, and there was no other indication at the crossing, or on the approaches. There was no requirement for signs or other indications to be provided by Network Rail, or any other organisation, to indicate that the general public were not permitted to take vehicles onto the level crossing.\n\nThe investigation identified three observations, unrelated to the accident, relating to level crossing signage, correct sounding of train warning horns and provision of reliable images from CCTV cameras fitted to trains.\n\nThe RAIB has made six recommendations. Four addressed to Network Rail, one addressed to the ORR and one addressed to the Department for Transport relate to improved content and positioning of information provided to level crossing users. Two recommendations addressed to Network Rail require it to seek a better understanding of actual (not only permitted) use of level crossings, and, in conjunction with highway authorities, to raise public awareness of locations where the general public are not permitted to take vehicles onto level crossings.\n\nR052015_150528_Frampton_LC\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Frampton level crossing\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_at_frampton_level_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 24 November 2012, at 22:26 hrs, a member of the public fell between a train and the edge of platform three at Charing Cross (main line) station in London. The train began to move a few seconds after she fell; she came into contact with the wheels and suffered life-changing injuries. The train stopped after moving about 43 metres.\n\nThe train was dispatched by a member of staff on the platform, who operated an indicator which told the train driver when it was safe to start. The person approached the train after this indicator had been operated, and the dispatcher had no means of alerting the train driver to what had happened. The train was stopped by a passenger on board who operated the emergency communication handle. The person who was injured fell into the gap between the platform and the train bodyside, at a point between sets of train doors.\n\nThe RAIB has identified one learning point for the railway industry arising from this investigation, covering the particular hazards that should be addressed in the industry’s response to the RAIB’s previous recommendation concerning the train dispatch process, made following the investigation into a fatal accident at James Street, Liverpool, in October 2011.\n\nR102013-130725-Charing-Cross.pdf \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accident_at_charing_cross_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  This class investigation considers the occurrence and management of rail breaks on Network Rail’s East Coast Main Line (ECML). It includes consideration of rail breaks which occurred at three locations during 2012 and 2013 and which, together with reports that the occurrence of rail breaks on the ECML was relatively high, triggered the investigation. None of these three rail breaks resulted in injuries or damage to trains.\n\nA rail break at Corby Glen, near Grantham was triggered by wear of the pad intended to separate the rail from the underlying concrete sleeper. Breaks at Copmanthorpe, near York, and at Hambleton, about 15 miles (24 km) south of York, were due to movement at rail joints caused by inadequate support from the underlying ground.\n\nRail break statistics show that, after allowing for differences in route length and the amount of traffic, the ECML has more rail breaks than comparable main lines. After considering both the types of rail break occurring on the ECML and the measures being taken by Network Rail to manage these, the investigation concluded that the most significant factor in the relatively high number of rail breaks on the ECML between 2009 and 2013 was the relatively high proportion of older track.\n\nNetwork Rail has recognised the relatively high level of rail breaks on the ECML and is replacing older track components on this line. It has also altered the maintenance criteria on the ECML to increase the likelihood of replacing moving (dipped) joints before they cause rail breaks. These measures appear to be reflected in a recent reduction in the occurrence of rail breaks.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations relating to rail breaks and addressed to Network Rail. The first seeks research to improve detection of the very small precursor cracks which usually occur in rails a significant period before the rail breaks. The second relates to the wider adoption of lessons learnt from managing rail breaks on the ECML while the third seeks a routine process for identifying and replacing defective rail pads. The fourth recommendation seeks implementation of improved techniques for detecting precursor cracks if trials using equipment recently fitted to Network Rail’s test trains (ultrasonic testing units) prove successful.\n\nA fifth recommendation, also addressed to Network Rail, arises from an observation not directly related to rail breaks and deals with improved highlighting of updated information in safety critical documents.\n\nR242014-141113-ECML-Rail-Breaks.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for East Coast Main Line rail breaks\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/rail_breaks_on_the_east_coast_main_line.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 12:12 hrs on 20 November 2013, the 10:10 hrs passenger train from London Euston to Chester collided with the buffer stop at the end of the platform as it arrived at Chester station. The impact destroyed the buffer stop and caused the leading vehicle of the train to start to override the platform, demolishing a glass screen and damaging the platform. It was fortunate that there was no-one in this area at the time.\n\nSeveral passengers fell over as the train stopped, but did not report injuries. One passenger was taken to hospital as a precaution and was released later the same day. The front of the train was damaged by the impact and the leading bogie was derailed.\n\nPlatform 1 at Chester station was closed until 04:15 hrs on 22 November for recovery of the train and repair of the buffer stop.\n\nThe accident was caused by the train sliding on wet rails that were also contaminated with leaf residue and traces of lubricating oil. The train was not equipped with automatic sanding equipment, which could have applied sand to the rails to improve adhesion. The train was fitted with emergency sanding equipment but the driver did not activate this until the train was too close to the buffers to be able to stop before striking them.\n\nThe train involved was a class 221 unit operated by Virgin Trains. RAIB analysed records of low rail adhesion incidents on Network Rail infrastructure during Autumn 2013 and found several other cases of class 221 trains, and the similar class 220, encountering low adhesion when attempting to stop. In some cases the driver had to use the emergency sanding equipment. RAIB analysis found that, per attempted stop, class 220 and 221 trains were the most likely type of train to be involved in a low adhesion incident. Almost all other types of train are fitted with automatic sanding equipment, or equivalent.\n\nRAIB has identified two key learning points and made three recommendations. The operators of class 220 and 221 trains are recommended to fit equipment to their trains to automatically apply sand when wheel slide is detected during heavy braking (Virgin Trains has recently informed RAIB of its intention to fit such equipment to its fleet of class 221 trains). A recommendation is made to Virgin Trains to amend its operating instructions to drivers and a recommendation is made to RSSB to update the standard which governs the fitment of train sanding equipment.\n\nThe first learning point concerns the analysis of data from train data recorders to provide information on the location of low adhesion conditions on the network. The second learning point is that infrastructure managers need to be aware of changes in traffic patterns which necessitate the reassessment of the adequacy of buffer stops in terminal platforms.\n\nR262014-141124-Chester.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Chester station\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/buffer_stop_collision_at_chester_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 15 January 2007 a passenger train operated by First Great Western was approaching Kemble station from the south when it derailed causing minor damage to the infrastructure and to the train. There were no injuries. Train services were disrupted and the line was closed until 18 January 2007 to enable repairs to be undertaken.\n\nThe derailment was caused by debris on the track following the collapse of a wall immediately to the north of the railway. Contributory factors include heavier than average rainfall during December 2006 and January 2007, the poor drainage of the cutting slope and a reclassification of the cutting by Network Rail, which led to less frequent examinations.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations as a result of this incident. Both relate to the management of wall structures and their infrastructure.\n\nRAIB are conducting a further investigation into the management of earthworks by Network Rail and issues relating to the earthworks at Kemble identified during this investigation will be taken forward as part of this further investigation.\n\nR072008-080327-Kemble.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Kemble\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_kemble.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At around 11:34 hrs on 22 January 2014, a track worker was struck by a passenger train as it approached Newark North Gate station. He was part of a team of three carrying out ultrasonic inspection of two sets of points at Newark South Junction and was acting in the role of lookout. The accident happened around 70 metres south of the platforms at the station. \n\nA few minutes before the accident, the lookout and two colleagues arrived at the yard adjacent to the tracks in a van. One colleague was in charge of carrying out the inspections and the other, the ‘controller of site safety’ (COSS), was in overall charge of the safety of the team. They had planned to carry out the inspections on lines that were still open to traffic in accordance with a pre-planned safe system of work. All three had many years of relevant experience in their respective roles and were familiar with the work site. \n\nUpon arrival at the yard, the lookout and tester proceeded to the track to start the inspection work; the COSS remained in the van. Shortly after they had started the inspection, the 10:08 hrs London to Newark North Gate passenger service approached. It was due to stop in platform 3, which required it to negotiate two sets of crossovers. The train blew a warning horn and the two staff on site acknowledged the warning and moved to the nominated place of safety. However, just before the train moved onto the first crossover, the lookout turned to face away from the train, walked towards the station and then out of the position of safety. He moved to a position close to where he had been before the train approached, most probably to check for trains approaching in the opposite direction, having decided that the approaching train was proceeding straight into platform 1. Although the train braked and blew a second warning horn, the lookout did not turn to face the train until it was too late for him to take evasive action.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations and identified a learning point. The recommendations are addressed to Network Rail and relate to: \n\n\n  improving work site safety discipline and vigilance, especially for teams doing routine work with which they are familiar\n  improving the implementation of Network Rail’s procedures for planning safe systems of work so that the method of working that is chosen minimises the risk to track workers so far as is reasonably practicable, as intended by the procedure.\n\n\nThe learning point relates to improving the implementation of Network Rail’s competence assurance process by providing training and sufficient working time to enable front line managers to implement the associated procedures as intended by Network Rail. \n\nR012015_150216_Newark_North_Gate \n\nReport 01/2015 - Published 16/02/2015\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Newark North Gate\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/fatal_accident_near_newark_north_gate_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 11:44 hrs on 16 July 2013 a collision occurred between a passenger train and a farm trailer at Buttington Hall farm crossing near Welshpool on the line between Shrewsbury and Machynlleth. The tractor driver and two other people nearby sustained minor injuries and two passengers on the train were injured and taken to hospital, but were discharged later that day.\n\nThe train involved was operated by Arriva Trains Wales and consisted of two 2-car units. It was travelling at 120 km/h (75 mph) at the time of the collision. The train was running from Birmingham International to Aberystwyth and Pwllheli and there were 140 passengers and two crew members on board. On the day of the accident, the farm crossing was being used by tractors bringing in a harvest from fields on the opposite side of the line to the farm. The farmer had appointed a contractor to carry out the harvesting operation, and an attendant had been provided at the crossing to phone the signaller and operate the gates.\n\nThe accident occurred because the system of work in use at the crossing was inherently unsafe, leading to ineffective control of road vehicle movements over the crossing and frequent use of the crossing without the signaller being contacted. This system broke down. There were also underlying management factors:\n\n\n  the harvest contractor did not implement an effective safe system of work at the crossing\n  Network Rail’s process for risk assessment of these types of crossing did not adequately deal with periods of intensive use\n  Network Rail’s instructions to users of these crossings did not cover periods of intensive use.\n\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations:\n\n\n  main line infrastructure managers should improve the risk assessment process at these crossings to take into account the increased risk during periods of intensive use\n  main line infrastructure managers should define safe and practical methods of working to be adopted at these crossings during periods of intensive use\n  RSSB should update the level crossing risk management toolkit to reflect the changes brought about by the second recommendation.\n\n\nRAIB has also noted a learning point from an observation made during the investigation concerning the prolonged closure of an adjacent level crossing on a main road after the accident.\n\nR062014-140327-Buttington-Hall-V2.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Buttington Hall \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_buttington_hall_user_worked_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 16:00 hours on 1 August 2013, concrete cladding fell from the bridge spanning Denmark Hill station, London, and most of the debris landed on platform 1. The fallen concrete was reported by two train drivers and train services were stopped on the line closest to the fallen concrete. Fortunately no-one was struck and there was no damage to trains. However, train services were disrupted until 02:48 hrs the following day while emergency repairs were carried out.\n\nThe concrete cladding had been added to the bridge structure in about 1910 and fell because of gradual deterioration of the fixing arrangements. Deterioration of the cladding fixing arrangements had been reported to Network Rail over a period of at least four years but the resulting actions taken by Network Rail and its works contractor were inadequate.\n\nRAIB has identified several factors which led to the absence of appropriate remedial work. Urgent repairs were not implemented in a timely manner and information collected by examiners was not entered promptly onto Network Rail’s asset management database (CARRS). Communications between Network Rail’s asset management and works delivery team were sometimes ineffective. Remedial work was not always precisely specified, staff implementing the work sometimes lacked the necessary competencies, and processes for verifying completion of remedial work were inadequate. Repeated reports of the same defect should have, but did not, led Network Rail to recognise that remedial works instructions were not achieving the intended effect. The high workload of some staff is a possible factor. Non-compliance with Network Rail’s maximum permitted intervals between bridge examinations was noted but was not a factor in the incident.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation and identified one learning point in addition to referencing previous RAIB recommendations relevant to issues identified at Denmark Hill. The recommendation requires Network Rail to review its processes for evaluating reported defects and managing the associated repairs. The learning point reinforces the importance of rigorously recording structure defects reported by examiners.\n\nR232014-141023-Denmark-Hill.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Denmark Hill station\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/dangerous_occurrence_at_denmark_hill_station.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Monday 11 September 2006 an empty South West Trains service was moving into Waterloo south sidings at low speed when it derailed on a set of points. These points had recently been subjected to unplanned maintenance.\n\nOn Tuesday 24 October 2006 a South West Trains service from Dorking to Waterloo derailed on a different set of points on the approaches to Waterloo. These points had also recently been subject to unplanned maintenance. Again, the derailment happened at low speed and there were no injuries. Some signalling and electrification equipment was damaged in the incident, and services from Waterloo were affected for several days while repairs were undertaken to the affected points and others exhibiting similar defects.\n\nThe immediate cause of both derailments was the condition of the switch blades within each set of points. These exhibited known derailment risks which had not been identified by the routine inspection process or by detailed inspections following maintenance activity. There were four causal and 13 contributory factors to the derailments.\n\nThere were six underlying causes to the derailment, which covered records management, understanding of standards and their requirements and inadequate track access for checking points.\n\nRAIB has made fourteen recommendations as a result of these incidents. These are aimed at:\n\n\n  the standards and guidance relating to points inspections\n  the training of inspection staff\n  the communication of information arising from inspections\n  track access\n  the management of sub-contractors.\n\n\nR442007-071218-Waterloo.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for London Waterloo 2007 \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailments_at_london_waterloo.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Wednesday 15 February a member of the public was standing on the edge of the platform at Huntingdon station seeing a passenger off when he became trapped by his coat in the door of the train. As the train departed the man ran, and then was pulled along the platform, before falling down the gap between the train and platform edge. The man sustained serious injuries to his left arm and hand.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was the train pulling away with the injured man’s coat trapped in the door. Contributing factors were the actions of the injured person before the train doors closed; the design of the train’s doors; the position of the train in relation to the CCTV monitors on the platform and the design of these monitors; and the presence of other passengers on the platform.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations aimed at:\n\n\n  driver training;\n  design of CCTV monitors;\n  the design of Class 365 train doors;\n  positioning of CCTV monitors at Huntingdon station;\n  safety standards for train doors;\n  improved signage and controls for emergency exits at doors on Class 365 trains.\n\n\nR112007-070430-Huntingdon-v2.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Huntingdon\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/huntingdon_train_door_incident.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 1 August 2007 a stanchion on an EWS freight train struck and damaged a Central Trains passenger train as they passed in opposite directions near Burton on Trent station. There were no injuries, but the collision caused some damage to the passenger train.\n\nThe immediate cause of the incident was a fractured stanchion on the freight train, which moved out to a horizontal position as the passenger train passed in the opposite direction. Causal factors were the stanchion box becoming detached, having previously been fractured along three sides, and the fractured stanchion not being detected before the freight train began its journey. There were three contributory factors to the incident.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of this incident.

'\n  At about 16:21 hrs on 20 January 2008 the driver of train 1B78, the 14:25 hrs from London Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport, was standing alongside his train while two fitters made repairs to it. The driver had to take rapid evasive action to avoid being struck by another train travelling at speed on the adjacent line and threw himself to the ground as the train passed. No-one was hurt in the incident, and there was no damage to trains or infrastructure.\n\nThe RAIB investigation identified that the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver of train 1B78 had not made arrangements for his own protection before going on the line.\n\nCausal factors were that the driver did not inform the signaller or request a blockage of the adjacent line before getting out of his cab, the signaller was unaware that the driver had left his cab and did not take any action to caution trains past the failed train or block the other line, the driver assumed that all trains were being cautioned past his failed train and the fitters did not make arrangements for their own protection as required.\n\nAs a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made five recommendations targeted at Network Rail and London Eastern Railway (National Express East Anglia). These cover the quality of safety critical communications in the Anglia area , the protection arrangements that apply when drivers need to go on the track, the documents used in signal boxes for recording unusual incidents and the provision of information about trackside hazards to staff working on failed trains.\n\nR262008-081223-Bishops-Stortford.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Bishop’s Stortford \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/near_miss_bishop’s_stortford.txt','Heavy rail'

The person who was struck was one of a team of eight people carrying out maintenance work on the track, and he was seriously injured. There was no damage to the train or infrastructure.\n\nThe investigation has identified that the track worker who was struck did not move to a position of safety and remained in the path of the train as it passed through the junction. The track worker had not expected the train to follow the route which took it onto the line on which he was working.\n\nNo satisfactory safe system of work had been established, and staff did not always move to a position of safety when the lookout warned that trains were approaching.\n\nRAIB has made two recommendations to Network Rail relating to reducing the risk of working at junctions, and the behaviour of staff working at locations with extended sighting of approaching trains.\n\nR062011-110323-Cheshunt.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Cheshunt Junction\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/track_worker_struck_at_cheshunt_junction.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 27 January 2009 the last six tank wagons of a ten-wagon dangerous goods train, carrying a mixed consignment of gas oil, diesel and kerosene to a fuel depot south of Kilmarnock, derailed as the train crossed a metal underbridge south of Stewarton, Ayrshire.  The bridge, which takes the railway over the A735 road, collapsed and the derailed wagons overturned, coming to rest at various positions to the south of the bridge.  Fuel from four of the derailed wagons leaked into the local environment and watercourses, and there were localised fires.  There were no fatalities or injuries. \n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the collapse of the bridge (Bridge 88) that followed the catastrophic structural failure of its east and centre main girders.  Heavy corrosion had so significantly weakened these main girders that they were no longer able to carry the loading from trains that were permitted to run over the bridge.\n\nThe causal factors were: the form of construction meant there was a hidden corrosion trap that affected the inner surfaces of the main girders; the corrosion resulted in a loss of thickness of the web plates of these girders allowing holes to form; and the use of incorrectly assumed dimensions for the thicknesses of these web plates in the last two routine assessments meant the reports of corrosion defects were not acted upon. \n\nRAIB has made twelve recommendations concerning checks and intervention action on bridges; improvements to the management of the information used for making decisions about the structural safety of bridges and the structures assessment procedure; evaluation of the use of track geometry recordings as a means of identifying structural issues with railway underbridges; improvements to the construction of existing tank wagons registered in Great Britain; and evaluation of improvements to international regulations concerning tank wagon design.\n\nR022010-100203-Stewarton.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Stewarton \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_of_a_freight_train_near_stewarton.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At about 02:40 hrs on 15 October 2013, a freight train travelling from Birmingham to Felixstowe derailed close to the site of the former Primrose Hill station in north-west London. There were no injuries as a consequence of the accident, although there was damage to the train and to railway infrastructure. The North London route, which carries London Overground passenger services as well as freight trains, was subsequently closed for six days.\n\nOne wagon in the train ran derailed until the train reached a junction near Camden Road station. At this point, an empty container toppled off the wagon and damaged overhead line electrification equipment. The derailment was caused by a combination of the track geometry and condition, as well as the longitudinal and lateral asymmetric loading of the wagon which reduced its resistance to derailment on twisted track.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations. These cover:\n\n\n  the provision by Network Rail of guidance to managers responsible for track maintenance on the actions to be taken if measurements by track recording vehicles do not take place as planned; \n  consideration of the factors that contribute to the derailment of unevenly loaded container wagons, and the associated risk, with cross-industry evaluation of the case for additional measures to mitigate the risk; and \n  the clarification by RSSB of the requirements for the design and acceptance of freight wagons.\n\n\nAs a learning point from this accident, RAIB has also identified that Network Rail should give particular attention to the possible consequences of a high turnover of responsible staff during reorganisations. \n\nR212014-141014-Camden-Road-West-Jn.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for  Primrose Hill, Camden Road\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_primrose_hill_camden_road_west_junction.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  At around 11:55 hrs, the 11:36 hrs passenger train from London Paddington to West Ruislip, operated by Chiltern Railways, passed two consecutive signals at danger near Greenford, west London. It was stopped when a signaller sent an emergency radio message to the driver. Although no-one was hurt in the incident, the unauthorised entry of a train onto a single line creates the potential for a serious collision.\n\nA freight train had passed the junction at Greenford shortly before the passenger train was due. Because the freight train was still occupying the line between Greenford and South Ruislip, the signaller at Greenford kept the signal at the junction at danger. The passenger train, travelling at about 20 mph (32 km/h), passed this signal and the next one, 142 yards (130 metres) further on, which was also at danger. It passed over the junction and onto the single-track section towards South Ruislip, which was still occupied by the freight train. The train had travelled about one mile (1.6 km) beyond Greenford by the time that the driver received the emergency radio message.\n\nThe investigation found that the driver of the passenger train did not react to the two signals at danger, for reasons which are not certain. It is possible that he had formed the impression that the train had been given clear signals through Greenford, because of his interpretation of the meaning of the signal preceding those that he passed at danger, and he had not been stopped by signals at Greenford in the recent past.\n\nThe Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) was fitted to the train and to both the signals, but it did not intervene to apply the brakes of the train, as it was intended to do. This was because the on-train TPWS equipment had self-isolated when the driver prepared the train for departure from Paddington. The isolation of the equipment was indicated by a flashing light in the cab, but the driver still drove the train.\n\nAlthough the signaller at Greenford wished to stop the train by sending an emergency call on the GSM-R radio system, he did not attempt to do so because the information presented by the radio equipment in the signal box suggested to him that any message he sent would not reach the train. Instead, he contacted Marylebone signal box, which was able to send a message to the train.\n\nRAIB has made three recommendations. One is addressed to Chiltern Railways, and covers the need for a review of the company’s driver management processes. The other two, addressed to Network Rail, cover the configuration of the GSM-R radio system as it affects the ability of signallers to directly contact trains that are within their areas of control, and the training given to signallers in the use of the GSM-R system. RAIB has also identified two learning points: one for signallers, relating to the use of delayed clearance of signals to warn train drivers of the state of the line ahead, and the other for train operating companies, relating to the upgrading of on-train TPWS equipment.\n\nR292014_141222_Greenford.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Greenford\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/unauthorised_entry_of_a_train_onto_a_single_line_at_greenford.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  In the early hours of 17 August 2010, a northbound freight train was travelling uphill on the West Coast Main Line between Tebay and Shap Summit in Cumbria. At 02:04 hrs the train slowed to a stop and then ran back until the driver braked and the train came to a stand at 02:09 hrs. During the run-back the train reached a maximum speed of 51 mph (82 km/h) and travelled 2.2 miles (3.5 km). The incident caused no injuries or damage; however the consequences could have been worse. If the driver had not braked when he did, the rear of the train would have travelled over a turnout into Tebay sidings at an excessive speed, which may have led to derailment, damage and obstruction of the adjacent line on which trains travel south.\n\nThe investigation found that DB Schenker’s train driver, who was working the first of a series of night shifts, was probably fatigued and not sufficiently alert at the time of the incident. It also found that although DB Schenker had used a recommended mathematical model and industry guidance to plan the shift, the driver had been exposed to a work pattern that was likely to induce high levels of fatigue. The report concludes that the mathematical model adopted by most of the rail industry is likely to under-predict the probability that high levels of fatigue will be experienced by people working a first night shift.\n\nThis report makes one recommendation to DB Schenker concerning its management of fatigue, two recommendations to the Office of Rail Regulation concerning guidance on the management of fatigue and the accuracy of mathematical models used to predict fatigue, and one recommendation to RSSB on improving rail industry information on fatigue-related accidents and incidents.\n\nR152011-110815-Shap-Summit.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Shap and Tebay\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/uncontrolled_freight_train_run-back_shap_summit.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  At 00:11 hrs on 27 November 2014 two engineering vehicles (that were part of a new overhead line wiring train) ran away on a gradient close to Bryn station, near Wigan.

This caused the brakes to release and, because it also caused the brake controls on the wagon to become disabled, the wiring team were unable to reapply them. No design, change management, approval or risk assessment work had identified the need for a safety measure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the error. \n\nRAIB has identified two underlying factors that help explain why the parties involved had not realised the significance of changes that were proposed to the use of the haulage vehicle. In summary, when developing the new train, they followed a philosophy of minimising technical change and they did not adopt a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and management of requirements and interfaces (a system-based design approach).\n\nAs a consequence of this investigation, RAIB has made five recommendations.\n\nThree are to Balfour Beatty Rail, the operator of the vehicles, concerning:\n\n\n  ensuring improved hazard identification when introducing and operating railborne plant\n  properly assessing and managing the risk implications of making changes to the design and use of its equipment\n  improving the quality of the alterations it makes to electrical systems on its equipment.\n\n\nOne recommendation is to RSSB concerns clarification of its guidance to the rail industry concerning the management of changes relating to the design, operation and maintenance of vehicles and plant operating in engineering possessions.\n\nOne recommendation is to Network Rail to ensure the risks associated with the introduction of new and modified railborne plant are properly managed before such plant is allowed to operate on its infrastructure.\n\nR092016_160509_Bryn\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/runaway_and_collision_at_bryn_station_wigan.txt','Heavy rail'

'\n  On Wednesday 19 October 2005 the 10:45 WAGN service from King’s Cross to King’s Lynn collided with a tractor, which was hauling a trailer over a user worked level crossing between Littleport and Downham Market.\n\nThe accident led to the destruction of the tractor and the death of its driver. The leading vehicle of the train was damaged in the impact, and minor injuries were sustained by the train driver and a passenger.\n\nThe immediate cause of the accident was that the driver started to cross the railway line despite the miniature stop light being red and with a train approaching at speed. Casual factors were the possibility that the gates may have been left open prior to the tractors arrival, that the tractor driver may not have noticed the stop lights, and the limited visibility of the line from the tractor. There are two alternative underlying causes, but it is not possible to distinguish which of these was the cause on the evidence available.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations as a result of its investigation:\n\n\n  Infrastructure Owners to manage lineside vegetation to improve visibility at user worked crossings \n  ORR (HMRI) and Department for Transport to evaluate whether highway signs at user worked crossings are appropriately designed and located \n  Network Rail to maintain records of the features required at each user worked crossing \n  Infrastructure Owners to regularly write to all users of user worked crossings to draw their attention to the safe method of use.\n\n\n \nR122006-060721-BlackHorseDrove.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Black Horse Drove\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/collision_at_black_horse_drove_crossing.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On 28 August 2013 a wheelchair user and her carer were waiting at Southend Central station for the arrival of a train when the wheelchair started to roll towards the edge of the platform, and then fell onto the track. Although the passenger and her wheelchair were recovered to the platform before the train arrived, the passenger was seriously injured in the fall. \n\nOn 18 September 2013, a mother and her two young children entered Whyteleafe station, near Caterham in Surrey. As the mother was purchasing a ticket from the ticket machine on the platform, the pushchair with baby strapped in started to roll away. The mother was unaware of this until it was too late to stop the pushchair rolling off the edge of the platform and onto the track. The baby suffered minor injuries in the fall.\n\nRAIB’s investigation into the accidents found that the platforms at both Southend Central and Whyteleafe stations sloped towards the railway. At the time of their construction there was no specific requirement for platforms to slope away from the railway.\n\nRAIB’s investigation also found that the individuals in charge of the wheelchair and pushchair had not applied the brakes and had not noticed that the platform sloped towards the track. There was nothing to alert users of either station to the presence of the slope.\n\nThe railway industry had generally recorded previous incidents of a similar nature as due solely to errors by the individuals concerned. As a consequence, the industry had not recognised the part that sloping platforms had played in the incidents.\n\nRAIB has identified one learning point for the railway industry in relation to the importance of providing a means for station staff to contact signallers in case of emergency.\n\nRAIB has made four recommendations. One recommendation has been made to Network Rail and the train operators (who as ‘Station Facility Operators’ are responsible for the safety of passengers at most stations in Britain) in respect of improvements in their processes for managing the risk of wheelchairs or pushchairs rolling off platforms. Two recommendations have been made to Network Rail for work to be undertaken to improve industry’s understanding of the role played by platform slopes in incidents and accidents and methods for managing the risk, and for improving intelligence on accidents and incidents where slopes on platforms may have been a causal factor. One recommendation has been made to the Association of Train Operating Companies on the provision of guidance on methods for managing the risk of wheelchairs or pushchairs rolling off platforms.\n\nR172014-140814-Southend-Whyteleafe.pdf \n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB Recommendation response for Southend Central and Whyteleafe \n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/accidents_at_southend_central_and_whyteleafe_stations.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Saturday 26 November 2005 a First Scotrail train travelling from Inverness to Edinburgh derailed after encountering a landslip at a cutting north of Moy in Inverness-shire. All the wheels of the leading car derailed and the train travelled approximately 122 metres before coming to rest upright. Six passengers and two members of staff were slightly injured and the leading vehicle was damaged.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was the train running into material deposited on the track as a result of the cutting landslip. There were two factors contributing to the derailment, and the root cause was that Network Rail did not identify the drainage risks that were imported by the recent building of a Parking Area above the crest of the failed cutting slope.\n\nRAIB has made ten recommendations as a result of its investigation.\n\nR222006-061129-Moy.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Moy\n\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_near_moy_inverness-shire.txt','Heavy rail'
'\n  On Tuesday 31 January a freight train was traversing the Cricklewood Curve at 7.5 mph when two wagons derailed. The wagons overturned and started to slide down the embankment, but were held by their couplings to the rest of the train. There were no injuries as a result of the accident, but residents of flats at the foot of the embankment were evacuated as a precaution.\n\nThe immediate cause of the derailment was a severe track twist, brought about by movement of the embankment at the site of repair works to address previous movements. Track maintenance staff had not appreciated the severity of the movement before the derailment and did not carry out remedial work. A risk assessment had identified embankment movement as the greatest risk during the works, but this was not fully considered by the Network Rail staff involved in planning the work.\n\nRAIB has made six recommendations as a result of its investigation. They cover:\n\n\n  application of construction regulations;\n  project management systems and associated technical control; and\n  technical standards regarding track deterioration.\n\n\nR022007-070123-Cricklewood.pdf\n\nResponse to recommendations:\n\n\n  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.\n  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.\n\n\nRAIB recommendation response for Cricklewood\n\n','/home/wattams/temp/raib-scrape/data/txt/./Heavy rail/derailment_at_cricklewood_curve.txt','Heavy rail'
