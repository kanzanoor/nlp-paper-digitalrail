  Tram 112, carrying around 20 passengers and travelling north-east towards Meadowhall, Sheffield, struck and seriously injured a pedestrian on the foot/cycle crossing adjacent to the Staniforth/Woodbourn road junction. The pedestrian, who had been walking away from the city centre along Woodbourn Road beside the tramway, stepped onto the crossing directly in front of the oncoming tram. On being struck, the pedestrian was thrown onto the road junction some distance from the tramlines. The tram continued across the foot/cycle crossing and the road junction before coming to a stop. No-one on the tram was injured. Three recommendations are made to improve tramway safety.
