  At 00:16 hrs on 5 June 2011, a Manchester Metrolink tram struck and fatally injured a pedestrian.

The tram was approaching Piccadilly Gardens, from the direction of Market Street, at a speed of about 9 mph (15 km/h) when a pedestrian ran into its path. The pedestrian appeared to become aware of the tram and tried to stop before reaching the track, but fell directly in front of the tram. Although the tram had started to brake before reaching the pedestrian, it did not come to a complete stand before the pedestrian had come into contact with the under-run protector. This is a device that projects down from the underside of the tram and is designed to prevent pedestrians from being crushed under the wheels.

RAIB has made two recommendations to UK tram operators in conjunction with UKTram (a body representing UK tram operators). These relate to improvements in the collection of pedestrian injury data in order to better understand the role of the tram front end design in minimising injury, and to research into the design of tram front ends and their potential for injuring pedestrians in collisions.
