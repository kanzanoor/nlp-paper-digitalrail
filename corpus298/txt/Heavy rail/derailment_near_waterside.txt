  On Saturday 21 January the rear six wagons of a freight train travelling from Chalmerston to Carlisle derailed near Waterside. There were no injuries, but over two miles of the freight-only track was damaged in the incident.

The immediate cause of the incident was a fracture on the running rail within a section of track owned by Scottish Coal, which allowed the leading wheelset of one wagon to derail. The following five wagons remained on the track but derailed as the train came to a stand. There were four causal factors and six contributory factors to the incident.

RAIB has made seven recommendations as a result of its investigation, covering the arrangements for the management of the track.
