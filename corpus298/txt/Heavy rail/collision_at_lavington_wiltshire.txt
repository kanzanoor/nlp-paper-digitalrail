  At around 14:09 hrs on Saturday 10 July 2010, the 13:06 hrs First Great Western service from Paddington to Penzance collided with a tree which had fallen from adjacent land at Lavington, Wiltshire. The train was travelling at about 90 mph (145 km/h) at the time the collision occurred and the leading cab was extensively damaged. The train was disabled by the collision and was subsequently hauled to Westbury station, arriving at 19:03 hrs.

The driver sustained minor injuries, but no-one else was injured.

RAIB has made four recommendations. Two recommendations have been made to Network Rail concerning the evaluation of risk from trees on adjacent land and communicating with landowners. A further recommendation has been made to Network Rail regarding the actions of signallers when undertaking safety-critical communications. One recommendation has been made to First Great Western regarding their policy on the use of mobile telephones by traincrew.
