  The RAIB investigation used data from a series of accidents and incidents which occurred at user worked level crossings between June 2006 and December 2008, and other information on crossing use, research programmes and current initiatives gathered by the RAIB from level crossing operators, train operators, and crossing users. The report looks at possible measures to reduce the risk at user worked level crossings.

As a consequence of this investigation, the RAIB has made a submission to the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in connection with their current joint project to review the law relating to level crossings. These propose changes to the law in connection with:


  consultation on planning applications which may affect level crossings 
  rights of way over private crossings
  protection measures for level crossings 
  duties of crossing users 
  the mechanism for permanent closure of crossings 


The RAIB has also made eight recommendations, which are targeted at Network Rail, Northern Ireland Railways, the Heritage Railway Association, and the Department for Transport, covering the following areas:


  involvement of the crossing user in the preparation of risk assessments 
  additional factors that should be included in risk assessments 
  marking of the point from which a decision to cross should be made 
  improved protection at crossings where adequate sighting is not achievable 
  closure of crossings not adequately protected 
  assessment of alternative methods of crossing protection 
  review of the requirements for signs at crossings
