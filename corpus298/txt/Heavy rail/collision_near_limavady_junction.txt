  On 2 August 2007 at approximately 15:22 hrs, train B413, the Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) service from Londonderry was 700 metres away from the disused station at Limavady Junction when it collided with a tractor on crossing XL202. The tractor driver died as a result of his injuries.

The train was travelling at approximately 33 mph and the driver sounded the horn continuously as he approached the crossing. The train driver suffered shock and was taken to hospital. None of the 65 passengers or the conductor were injured; the train was damaged but did not derail. Rail services re-commenced early the next day.

The investigation identified that the tractor driver may have lost concentration as he approached the crossing. It suggests the position of the sun, the design of the crossing and the tractor’s roof support pillar may have affected the tractor driver’s view of the approaching train. NIR has now redesigned the crossing.

RAIB has made six recommendations relating to:


  level crossing signage
  management of risk at user worked crossings, and specifically crossing XL202
  improving the design of the evacuation ladders carried on NIR rolling stock.

  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
