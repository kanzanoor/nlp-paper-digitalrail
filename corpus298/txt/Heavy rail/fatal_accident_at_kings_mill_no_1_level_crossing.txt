  At around 16:32 hrs on 2 May 2012, a cyclist who was using the footpath and bridleway level crossing at Kings Mill, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, was struck and fatally injured by a passenger train travelling at about 56 miles per hour (90 kilometres per hour).

The cyclist rode over the crossing into the path of the train. He was unaware of the train’s approach, probably because he had not looked towards it after passing through the gate protecting the crossing and he was wearing earphones, which probably prevented him from hearing warnings sounded by the train’s horn.

The RAIB has made one recommendation, which is not related to the causes of the accident, but arises from matters relating to the management and history of the crossing that were observed during the investigation. Addressed to the Health & Safety Executive and the Office of Rail Regulation, it is intended to improve the awareness of local authorities (who may promote or approve developments which affect the usage of level crossings) in relation to the hazards which exist at level crossings.

There is also a key learning point for Network Rail and other crossing operators, relating to the importance of considering all possible measures to reduce risk at crossings, not just those that involve major changes.
