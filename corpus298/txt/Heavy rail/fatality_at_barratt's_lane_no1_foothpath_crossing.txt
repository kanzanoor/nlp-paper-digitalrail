  On Monday 21 November 2005 a train travelling towards Nottingham observed a person on Barratt’s Lane No.1 footpath crossing, shortly before Attenborough station. The driver sounded the train horn and braked, but struck the pedestrian on the crossing and fatally injured him. The pedestrian was knocked onto the opposite line where a second train, despite being given a visual warning to stop by the first train, was unable to stop short of the accident site and therefore passed over the body.

The immediate cause of the accident was the pedestrian being struck by a train while using the footpath crossing in foggy conditions. Contributing factors were the fog and the impaired hearing of the pedestrian.

RAIB has made no recommendations in this report.
