  At around 10.50hrs on Wednesday 29 August 2007, a train was driven through an emergency speed restriction of 20 mph between Newtown and Caersws on the Shrewsbury to Machynlleth line, close to Ty Mawr farm crossing at a speed of 75mph, reducing to 58 mph. There were no casualties, and no damage, as a result.

The RAIBâ€™s investigation identified that the immediate cause of the incident was that the driver forgot the advice he had been given of the emergency speed restriction. Causal factors were the lack of a means both within the driving cab and at the side of the track to remind the driver of the speed restriction ahead.

As a consequence of this accident RAIB has made seven recommendations, five targeted at Network Rail, one at the Rail Safety and Standards Board and one at the Association of Train Operating Companies.

The recommendations cover procedures for informing emergency speed restrictions to drivers, and reminding them of their existence, when they are imposed at a significant distance from their location.
