  At around 17:35 hrs on 8 January 2006, a cyclist suffered a serious injury as a result of the passage of a Northern Rail service from York to Leeds via Harrogate at Scate Moor bridleway crossing, between Cattal and Knaresborough.

The cyclist is the only person who was at the time aware of the accident. He has been unable to recall the period between approaching the slope and when the train was passing.

No failings that could contributed to the accident have been found relating to the railway infrastructure (including the crossing), the train, its operation or the signalling.

Therefore we make no recommendations in respect to this accident.
