  On Saturday 26 November 2005 a First Scotrail train travelling from Inverness to Edinburgh derailed after encountering a landslip at a cutting north of Moy in Inverness-shire. All the wheels of the leading car derailed and the train travelled approximately 122 metres before coming to rest upright. Six passengers and two members of staff were slightly injured and the leading vehicle was damaged.

The immediate cause of the derailment was the train running into material deposited on the track as a result of the cutting landslip. There were two factors contributing to the derailment, and the root cause was that Network Rail did not identify the drainage risks that were imported by the recent building of a Parking Area above the crest of the failed cutting slope.

RAIB has made ten recommendations as a result of its investigation.
