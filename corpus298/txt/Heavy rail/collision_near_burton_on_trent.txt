  On 1 August 2007 a stanchion on an EWS freight train struck and damaged a Central Trains passenger train as they passed in opposite directions near Burton on Trent station. There were no injuries, but the collision caused some damage to the passenger train.

The immediate cause of the incident was a fractured stanchion on the freight train, which moved out to a horizontal position as the passenger train passed in the opposite direction. Causal factors were the stanchion box becoming detached, having previously been fractured along three sides, and the fractured stanchion not being detected before the freight train began its journey. There were three contributory factors to the incident.

RAIB has made four recommendations as a result of this incident. These involve:


  the detection and replacement of damaged stanchions
  guidance on the criteria for replacing damaged stanchions
  the use of appropriate stanchions.
