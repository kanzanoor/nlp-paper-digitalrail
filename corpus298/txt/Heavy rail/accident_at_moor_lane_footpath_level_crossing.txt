  At about 08:10 hrs on 16 April 2008, a train travelling from London (Waterloo) to Windsor & Eton struck and fatally injured a pedestrian on Moor Lane footpath level crossing, near Staines, Surrey. There was no damage to the train or the infrastructure.

The immediate cause of the accident was that the pedestrian fell to the ground on the crossing and was unable to avoid being struck by the approaching train.

The RAIB’s investigation identified that causal factors were that the pedestrian did not stop, look and listen before stepping onto the crossing, the surface of the crossing was slippery and Network Rail had not added a non-slip surface to this crossing, although this had been considered by Railtrack in 1996 and requested by Her Majesty’s Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) in 2005.

There were other contributory factors related to the layout of the approach to the crossing, the relative quietness of the train and the background noise in the area.

As a consequence of this accident, RAIB have made four recommendations, all targeted at Network Rail, covering the provision of non-slip surfaces at level crossings, the operation of the computer system used by the maintenance organisation, and the guidance the company gives to its staff who assess and inspect level crossings. Since the accident, Network Rail has fitted a non-slip surface to the level crossing at Moor Lane.
