  On Wednesday 18 January the wagon of a freight train passing through York station ran derailed for approximately 250 metres. There were no injuries sustained as a result of this derailment, however it resulted in damage to the wagon and rail infrastructure.

The immediate cause of the incident was the collapse of the suspension at one wheel. The suspension collapse occurred because the maintenance regime did not detect the deterioration of a suspension component. There were also two other contributing factors.

RAIB has made four recommendations as a result of its investigation. All of these are associated with the maintenance of wagons and suspension components.
