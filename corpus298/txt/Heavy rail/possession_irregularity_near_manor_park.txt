  On 19 March 2006 a “one” London Liverpool Street to Ipswich service was travelling at 80mph under clear signals when it struck two wheelbarrows as it approached Manor Park station. The staff on the track with the wheelbarrows had been able to jump clear, but two workers were injured.

The immediate cause of the incident was the presence of a workgroup on the track outside the limits of a possession and without any means of protection. There were four causal factors and eight contributory factors to the incident. The underlying cause was the planning of complex work sites to encompass multiple jobs over many miles.

RAIB has made three recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:


  minimising of work site lengths within possessions
  improving planning procedures
  storing archived data.

  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
