The report was prepared jointly by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) in the UK and their counterparts in France, the Bureau d’Enquêtes sur les Accidents de Transport Terrestre (BEA-TT). The investigation was led by BEA-TT because the fire occurred on French territory (approximately 12 kilometres from the French portal of the tunnel). The ‘Protocol of Cooperation’ between BEA-TT and RAIB allocates responsibility for leading an investigation to the organisation from the country in which the accident or incident occurred.
