  At 1:30am on 5 December 2007, a road-rail vehicle (RRV) hauling a loaded trailer was unable to stop as it approached a work site where rock face repairs were taking place. Several site staff narrowly avoided injury by jumping clear. Although a low-speed collision occurred between the RRV and another RRV at the site, staff were not injured.

The RAIB investigation identified a number of immediate causal factors:


  the RRV’s trailer was not fitted with brakes adequate to stop it on the gradient 
  there were poor weather conditions
  it was likely there were wood chippings on the track. 


There were also a number of contributory factors, including:


  Network Rail did not advise their contractor of the gradient at the site 
  the machine operator was not aware of the risk of rail contamination from other work going on at the site
  the machine was travelling too fast
  the road tyres of the vehicle were not inflated to the correct pressure
  the operator’s training did not cover how to deal with a braking emergency.


As a consequence of this incident, RAIB has made seven recommendations targeted at Network Rail and the companies who own or operate road-rail vehicles. These include:


  providing briefing information for road-rail vehicle operators 
  putting in place competence systems and management for road-rail vehicle operators 
  the provision of a risk assessment for RRVs 
  the provision of service brakes on road-rail vehicle trailers

Response to recommendations:


  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
