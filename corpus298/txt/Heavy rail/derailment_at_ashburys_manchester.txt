  The derailment was caused by the fracturing, through to the axle, of the right-hand leading wheel of the trailing bogie. This resulted in the loss of the interference fit between the wheel and the axle and permitted the wheel to move inwards on the axle.

RAIB has identified a learning point for freight companies and staff who undertake the examination of freight trains, highlighting the need to check for signs of overheated wheels.
