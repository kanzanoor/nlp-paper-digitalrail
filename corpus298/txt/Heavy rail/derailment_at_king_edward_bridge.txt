  On 10 May 2007 at 06.40, an EWS empty coal train derailed on its approach to Newcastle station and caused significant damage to operating equipment on the track and King Edward Bridge; in addition several wagons were severely damaged. There were no injuries but train services were disrupted and some tracks were closed for several days.

The immediate cause of the incident was a combination of a relatively minor track defect and a distorted wagon frame. Causal factors involved the wagon experiencing a twist as it passed over a set of points. There were also five contributory factors.

RAIB has made four recommendations as a result of this incident. These involve:


  the design and maintenance of the Carlisle line crossover at King Edward Bridge
  standards for track inspection and maintenance
  procedures to detect defective wagons on the network.

  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
