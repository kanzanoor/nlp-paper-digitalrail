  On Wednesday 11 January 2006 a gang of track workers started to remove a rail on the line just north of Thirsk station. It was then discovered that the rail had been severed on a line that was still open to traffic, and that the worksite had been established outside of an engineering possession.

A range of causal factors and two contributory factors to this incident have been identified.

RAIB has made eight recommendations as a result of its investigation:


  One recommendation to the RSSB to covering forms used during possessionsÂ 
  Seven recommendations to Network Rail covering staff briefings, procedures and documentation.

  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
