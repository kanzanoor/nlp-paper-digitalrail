  At 17:58 hrs on 18 December 2008 a train struck an unoccupied car, derailed, and came to a stop as a train passed in the opposite direction. The passing train struck debris from the collision before it braked to a stop. There were no injuries as a consequence of the accident.

The RAIB investigation found that the collision occurred because:


  the car had rolled onto the railway from a car park after being left inadequately braked on a gradient (the car park is owned by UPS, a package delivery company)
  the car park fence was neither designed nor able to prevent the carâ€™s incursion
the railway controller was not alerted to the presence of the car on the track in time to stop trains
Network Rail had not considered the risk of vehicle incursion from adjoining private land
  UPS had not identified the risk of vehicle incursion onto the railway from its car park.


As a consequence of this accident, RAIB has targeted two recommendations at Network Rail and one at UPS. The recommendations cover:


  provisions for UPS to inform Network Rail immediately a road vehicle enters the railway
  improving the boundary of the UPS car park to reduce the likelihood and consequences of incursion onto the railway
  identifying and improving those sites where the risk of incursion from private land is highest.

Response to recommendations:


  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
