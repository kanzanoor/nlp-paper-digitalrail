  On 4th February 2006 a steam locomotive travelling at low speed towards Loughborough Central station  collided with the rearmost of six carriages berthed at platform 1. Two members of GCR staff sustained minor injuries. The locomotive and one carriage sustained damage.

The immediate cause of the collision was that the driver did not apply the locomotive brake. Factors that contributed to the incident were the driver and fireman being distracted from looking out, reduced visibility due to a concentration of steam, and the driverâ€™s reduced visual acuity when not wearing spectacles.

RAIB has made four recommendations to Great Central Railways as a result of our investigation. They cover:


  revising its Rule Book and training
  ensuring members of staff comply with the requirements of their medical certificates
  ensuring its policy on medical certification and recertification is properly applied
  ensuring a first aid kit is provided and clearly indicated in all locomotive cabs

  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
