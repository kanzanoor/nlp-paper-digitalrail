  On 15 September 2009, at 12:15 hrs, two trams travelling in opposite directions collided at the passing loop on the upper section of the Great Orme Tramway, Llandudno.  One person suffered minor injuries in the collision. 

The immediate cause of the collision was the lower points moving under the uphill tram directing the rear of the tram into the path of the downhill tram.

The causal factors were: the wheel forces overcoming the tumbler’s holding force and changing the position of the points; the effectiveness of the holding force on the points had reduced due to wear and degradation of the points and the tumbler; that the points at the upper loop did not have a facing point lock; and the Great Orme Tramway did not routinely measure the condition of the points and the tumbler mechanism because they did not have procedures for such measurements and for associated remedial actions.

RAIB has made two recommendations to Conwy Borough Council concerning: conducting a competent technical evaluation of the points and crossings on the Great Orme Tramway; comprehensive and competent audits carried out to identify any deficiencies associated with the operation and maintenance of the Tramway.
