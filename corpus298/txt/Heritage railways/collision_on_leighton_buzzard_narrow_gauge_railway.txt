  On Saturday 25 August 2007 a train on the Leighton Buzzard Railway collided with a tractor at low speed on Cavalry Horse User Worked Crossing, on the outskirts of Leighton Buzzard. One passenger was slightly injured, and damage was caused to the locomotive and the tractor.

The immediate cause of the incident was the tractor driving onto the crossing when a train was approaching. Causal factors were the inadequate visibility for road vehicles and the lack of recent vegetation cutting at the crossing, and a contributory factor was the lack of briefing for the owner of the field. The underlying cause was the Leighton Buzzard Railway’s lack of understanding of the need to assess and maintain visibility for road users on farm crossings.

RAIB has made two recommendations aimed at Leighton Buzzard Railway. These involve:


  the operation and visibility of crossings; 
  the management of vegetation; and 
  signage at level crossings.

Response to recommendations:


  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
