  A tram was approaching Seaton station on the Seaton tramway when it derailed at the points at the entry to the station. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.

The immediate cause of the derailment was the left-hand switch of the point lying open, possibly caused by unknown persons placing an object in the points. Contributory factors were a lack of visual indication to the driver of the position of the points, and the design of the points.

RAIB has made two recommendations aimed at:


  the design of the point lever at Seaton station; and
  the provision of visual indicators for drivers on the position of the points.

  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
