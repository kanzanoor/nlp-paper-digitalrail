  On 5 May 2007 a steam locomotive on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway was in the process of running round its train at Pickering station, when it entered the platform line from which it had come, and collided with the carriages it had left there.

The cause of the incident was the locomotive driver becoming distracted, and not changing the points before giving the fireman permission to drive across them.

RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at:


  the operation of the points at Pickering station
  procedures following an accident.

Response to recommendations:


  RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.
  RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.
