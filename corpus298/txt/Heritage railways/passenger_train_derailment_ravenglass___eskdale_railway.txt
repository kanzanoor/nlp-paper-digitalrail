  On 12 May 2007 a steam locomotive hauled passenger train was travelling from Dalegarth to Ravenglass at 5-7mph when the trailing bogie on the third coach derailed at Hollin How near Fisherground. There were no passenger injuries or significant damage to the train or track.

The cause of the derailment was flange climb of the leading right wheel of the trailing bogie on the third coach. This resulted directly from the collapse of the suspension on the left-hand side of the leading bogie, due to a compensating bar becoming detached. This probably occurred because the bar had not been refitted correctly after safety inspections, and the vehicle then entered service with the fault undetected.

RAIB has made two recommendations as a result of the report, aimed at the checking of safety critical work on the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway.
